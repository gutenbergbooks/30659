<h3><i>DEDICATION</i></h3>


<p><i>There are men and classes of men that stand above the common
herd: the soldier, the sailor, and the shepherd not unfrequently;
the artist rarely; rarelier still, the clergyman; the
physician almost as a rule. He is the flower (such as it is)
of our civilisation; and when that stage of man is done with,
and only remembered to be marvelled at in history, he will
be thought to have shared as little as any in the defects of the
period, and most notably exhibited the virtues of the race.
Generosity he has, such as is possible to those who practise
an art, never to those who drive a trade; discretion, tested
by a hundred secrets; tact, tried in a thousand embarrassments;
and, what are more important, Heraclean cheerfulness
and courage. So it is that he brings air and cheer into the
sickroom, and often enough, though not so often as he wishes,
brings healing.</i></p>

<p><i>Gratitude is but a lame sentiment; thanks, when they are
expressed, are often more embarrassing than welcome;
and yet I must set forth mine to a few out of many doctors who
have brought me comfort and help: to </i>Dr. Willey<i> of San
Francisco, whose kindness to a stranger it must be as grateful
to him, as it is touching to me, to remember; to </i>Dr. Karl
Ruedi<i> of Davos, the good genius of the English in his frosty
mountains; to </i>Dr. Herbert<i> of Paris, whom I knew only
for a week, and to </i>Dr. Caissot<i> of Montpellier, whom I knew
only for ten days, and who have yet written their names
deeply in my memory; to </i>Dr. Brandt<i> of Royat; to </i>Dr.
Wakefield<i> of Nice; to </i>Dr. Chepmell<i>, whose visits make it
a pleasure to be ill; to </i>Dr. Horace Dobell<i>, so wise in counsel;
to </i>Sir Andrew Clark<i>,  so unwearied in kindness; and to that
wise youth, my uncle, </i>Dr. Balfour<i>.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>64</span></p>

<p><i>I forget as many as I remember; and I ask both to pardon
me, these for silence, those for inadequate speech. But one
name I have kept on purpose to the last, because it is a household
word with me, and because if I had not received favours
from so many hands and in so many quarters of the world, it
should have stood upon this page alone: that of my friend
</i>Thomas Bodley Scott<i> of Bournemouth. Will he accept
this, although shared among so many, for a dedication to himself?
and when next my ill-fortune (which has thus its
pleasant side) brings him hurrying to me when he would
fain sit down to meat or lie down to rest, will he care to
remember that he takes this trouble for one who is not fool
enough to be ungrateful?</i></p>

<p>There, from of old, thy childhood passed; and there</p>
<p>High expectation, high delights and deeds,</p>
<p>Thy fluttering heart with hope and terror moved.</p>
<p>And thou hast heard of yore the Blatant Beast,</p>
<p>And Roland&rsquo;s horn, and that war-scattering shout</p>
<p>Of all-unarmed Achilles, ægis-crowned.</p>
<p>And perilous lands thou sawest, sounding shores</p>
<p>And seas and forests drear, island and dale</p>
<p>And mountain dark. For thou with Tristram rod&rsquo;st</p>
<p>Or Bedevere, in farthest Lyonesse.</p>
<p>Thou hadst a booth in Samarcand, whereat</p>
<p>Side-looking Magians trafficked; thence, by night,</p>
<p>An Afreet snatched thee, and with wings upbore</p>
<p>Beyond the Aral Mount; or, hoping gain,</p>
<p>Thou, with a jar of money, didst embark</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>81</span></p>
<p>For Balsorah by sea. But chiefly thou</p>
<p>In that clear air took&rsquo;st life; in Arcady</p>
<p>The haunted, land of song; and by the wells</p>
<p>Where most the gods frequent. There Chiron old,</p>
<p>In the Pelethronian antre, taught thee lore;</p>
<p>The plants he taught, and by the shining stars</p>
<p>In forests dim to steer. There hast thou seen</p>
<p>Immortal Pan dance secret in a glade,</p>
<p>And, dancing, roll his eyes; these, where they fell,</p>
<p>Shed glee, and through the congregated oaks</p>
<p>A flying horror winged; while all the earth</p>
<p>To the god&rsquo;s pregnant footing thrilled within.</p>
<p>Or whiles, beside the sobbing stream, he breathed,</p>
<p>In his clutched pipe unformed and wizard strains</p>
<p>Divine yet brutal; which the forest heard,</p>
<p>And thou, with awe; and far upon the plain</p>
<p>The unthinking ploughman started and gave ear.</p>

<p class="s">Now things there are that, upon him who sees,</p>
<p>A strong vocation lay; and strains there are</p>
<p>That whoso hears shall hear for evermore.</p>
<p>For evermore thou hear&rsquo;st immortal Pan</p>
<p>And those melodious godheads, ever young</p>
<p>And ever quiring, on the mountains old.</p>

<p class="s">What was this earth, child of the gods, to thee?</p>
<p>Forth from thy dreamland thou, a dreamer, cam&rsquo;st</p>
<p>And in thine ears the olden music rang,</p>
<p>And in thy mind the doings of the dead,</p>
<p>And those heroic ages long forgot.</p>
<p>To a so fallen earth, alas! too late,</p>
<p>Alas! in evil days, thy steps return,</p>
<p>To list at noon for nightingales, to grow</p>
<p>A dweller on the beach till Argo come</p>

<p>To right and leftward, like a questing dog,</p>
<p>Seeks first the ancestral altars, then the hearth</p>
<p>Long cold with rains, and where old terror lodged,</p>
<p>And where the dead: so thee undying Hope,</p>
<p>With all her pack, hunts screaming through the years:</p>
<p>Here, there, thou fleeëst; but nor here nor there</p>
<p>The pleasant gods abide, the glory dwells.</p>

<p>Long since her trembling rushes; from her plains</p>
<p>Disconsolate, long since adventure fled;</p>

<p>Nor rumour of the world of life,</p>
<p>Nor confidences low and dear,</p>

<p>Thou, O my love, ye, O my friends&mdash;</p>
<p>The gist of life, the end of ends&mdash;</p>
<p>To laugh, to love, to live, to die,</p>

<p>Captive?  ah, still, to honour bright,</p>
<p>A captive soldier of the right!</p>
<p>Or free and fighting, good with ill?</p>
<p>Unconquering but unconquered still!</p>

<p class="s">And ye, O brethren, what if God,</p>

<p>And sees on this tormented stage</p>
<p>The noble war of mankind rage:</p>
<p>What if His vivifying eye,</p>

<p>For still the Lord is Lord of might;</p>
<p>In deeds, in deeds, He takes delight;</p>
<p>The plough, the spear, the laden barks,</p>

<p>Sow gladness on the peopled lands.</p>

<h3>NOTE TO BOOK II</h3>

<p>The human conscience has fled of late the troublesome domain of
conduct for what I should have supposed to be the less congenial
field of art: there she may now be said to rage, and with special
severity in all that touches dialect: so that in every novel the
letters of the alphabet are tortured, and the reader wearied, to
commemorate shades of mispronunciation. Now, spelling is an art
of great difficulty in my eyes, and I am inclined to lean upon the
printer, even in common practice, rather than to venture abroad
upon new quests. And the Scots tongue has an orthography of its
own, lacking neither &ldquo;authority nor author.&rdquo; Yet the temptation
is great to lend a little guidance to the bewildered Englishman.
Some simple phonetic artifice might defend your verses from
barbarous mishandling, and yet not injure any vested interest.
So it seems at first; but there are rocks ahead. Thus, if I wish
the diphthong <i>ou</i> to have its proper value, I may write <i>oor</i> instead
of <i>our</i>; many have done so and lived, and the pillars of the universe
remained unshaken. But if I did so, and came presently to <i>doun</i>,
which is the classical Scots spelling of the English <i>down</i>, I should
begin to feel uneasy; and if I went on a little further, and came
to a classical Scots word, like <i>stour</i> or <i>dour</i> or <i>clour</i>, I should know
precisely where I was&mdash;that is to say, that I was out of sight of land
on those high seas of spelling reform in which so many strong
swimmers have toiled vainly. To some the situation is exhilarating;
as for me, I give one bubbling cry and sink. The compromise
at which I have arrived is indefensible, and I have no thought of
trying to defend it. As I have stuck for the most part to the proper
spelling, I append a table of some common vowel sounds which no
one need consult; and just to prove that I belong to my age and
have in me the stuff of a reformer, I have used modification marks
throughout. Thus I can tell myself, not without pride, that I have
added a fresh stumbling-block for English readers, and to a page of
print in my native tongue have lent a new uncouthness. <i>Sed non
nobis.</i></p>

<p>I note again, that among our new dialecticians, the local habitat
of every dialect is given to the square mile. I could not emulate
this nicety if I desired; for I simply wrote my Scots as well as I
was able, not caring if it hailed from Lauderdale or Angus, from the
Mearns or Galloway; if I had ever heard a good word, I used it
without shame; and when Scots was lacking, or the rhyme jibbed,
I was glad (like my betters) to fall back on English. For all that,
I own to a friendly feeling for the tongue of Fergusson and of Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>104</span>
Walter, both Edinburgh men; and I confess that Burns has always
sounded in my ear like something partly foreign. And indeed I
am from the Lothians myself; it is there I heard the language
spoken about my childhood; and it is in the drawling Lothian
voice that I repeat it to myself. Let the precisians call my speech
that of the Lothians. And if it be not pure, alas! what matters it?
The day draws near when this illustrious and malleable tongue
shall be quite forgotten; and Burns&rsquo;s Ayrshire, and Dr. MacDonald&rsquo;s
Aberdeen-awa&rsquo;, and Scott&rsquo;s brave, metropolitan utterance will be
all equally the ghosts of speech. Till then I would love to have my
hour as a native Maker, and be read by my own countryfolk in
our own dying language; an ambition surely rather of the heart
than of the head, so restricted as it is in prospect of endurance,
so parochial in bounds of space.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;It may be guessed by some that I had a certain parish in my
eye, and this makes it proper I should add a word of disclamation.
In my time there have been two ministers in that parish. Of
the first I have a special reason to speak well, even had there been
any to think ill. The second I have often met in private and long
(in the due phrase) &ldquo;sat under&rdquo; in his church, and neither here
nor there have I heard an unkind or ugly word upon his lips. The
preacher of the text had thus no original in that particular parish;
but when I was a boy, he might have been observed in many others;
he was then (like the schoolmaster) abroad; and by recent advices,
it would seem he has not yet entirely disappeared.&mdash;[R. L. S.]</p>

<p class="s">For after years wi&rsquo; a pockmantie</p>
<p>Frae Zanzibar to Alicante,</p>
<p>In mony a fash and sair affliction</p>

<p>For first I fand&mdash;an&rsquo; here was news!&mdash;</p>
<p>Mere hymn-books cockin&rsquo; in the pews&mdash;</p>
<p>A humanised abomination,</p>
<p>Unfit for ony congregation.</p>
<p>Syne, while I still was on the tenter,</p>
<p>I scunnered at the new prezentor;</p>
<p>I thocht him gesterin&rsquo; an&rsquo; cauld&mdash;</p>
<p>A sair declension frae the auld.</p>
<p>Syne, as though a&rsquo; the faith was wreckit,</p>
<p>The prayer was not what I&rsquo;d exspeckit.</p>
<p>Himsel&rsquo;, as it appeared to me,</p>
<p>Was no&rsquo; the man he üsed to be.</p>
<p>But just as I was growin&rsquo; vext</p>
<p>He waled a maist judeecious text,</p>
<p>An&rsquo;, launchin&rsquo; into his prelections,</p>
<p>Swoopt, wi&rsquo; a skirl, on a&rsquo; defections.</p>

<p class="s">O what a gale was on my speerit</p>
<p>To hear the p&rsquo;ints o&rsquo; doctrine clearit,</p>
<p>And a&rsquo; the horrors o&rsquo; damnation</p>
<p>Set furth wi&rsquo; faithfü&rsquo; ministration!</p>
<p>Nae shauchlin&rsquo; testimony here&mdash;</p>
<p>We were a&rsquo; damned, an&rsquo; that was clear.</p>

<h3>THE SLAYING OF TÁMATÉA</h3>


<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p><span class="sc">It</span> fell in the days of old, as the men of Taiárapu tell,</p>
<p>A youth went forth to the fishing, and fortune favoured him well.</p>
<p>Támatéa his name: gullible, simple, and kind.</p>
<p>Comely of countenance, nimble of body, empty of mind,</p>
<p>His mother ruled him and loved him beyond the wont of a wife,</p>
<p>Serving the lad for eyes and living herself in his life.</p>
<p>Alone from the sea and the fishing came Támatéa the fair,</p>
<p>Urging his boat to the beach, and the mother awaited him there.</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;Long may you live!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Your fishing has sped to a wish.</p>
<p>And now let us choose for the king the fairest of all your fish.</p>
<p>For fear inhabits the palace and grudging grows in the land,</p>
<p>Marked is the sluggardly foot and marked the niggardly hand,</p>
<p>The hours and the miles are counted, the tributes numbered and weighed,</p>
<p>And woe to him that comes short, and woe to him that delayed!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>140</span></p>
<p>So spoke on the beach the mother, and counselled the wiser thing.</p>
<p>For Rahéro stirred in the country and secretly mined the king.</p>
<p>Nor were the signals wanting of how the leaven wrought,</p>
<p>In the cords of obedience loosed and the tributes grudgingly brought.</p>
<p>And when last to the temple of Oro the boat with the victim sped,</p>
<p>And the priest uncovered the basket and looked on the face of the dead,</p>
<p>Trembling fell upon all at sight of an ominous thing,</p>
<p>For there was the aito<a name="FnAnchor_1c" href="#Footnote_1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> dead, and he of the house of the king.</p>

<p class="s">So spake on the beach the mother, matter worthy of note,</p>
<p>And wattled a basket well, and chose a fish from the boat;</p>
<p>And Támatéa the pliable shouldered the basket and went,</p>
<p>And travelled, and sang as he travelled, a lad that was well content.</p>
<p>Still the way of his going was round by the roaring coast,</p>
<p>Where the ring of the reef is broke and the trades run riot the most.</p>
<p>On his left, with smoke as of battle, the billows battered the land;</p>
<p>Unscalable, turreted mountains rose on the inner hand.</p>
<p>And cape, and village, and river, and vale, and mountain above,</p>
<p>Each had a name in the land for men to remember and love;</p>
<p>And never the name of a place, but lo! a song in its praise:</p>
<p>Ancient and unforgotten, songs of the earlier days</p>
<p>That the elders taught to the young, and at night, in the full of the moon,</p>
<p>Garlanded boys and maidens sang together in tune.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>141</span></p>
<p>Támatéa the placable went with a lingering foot;</p>
<p>He sang as loud as a bird, he whistled hoarse as a flute;</p>
<p>He broiled in the sun, he breathed in the grateful shadow of trees,</p>
<p>In the icy stream of the rivers he waded over the knees;</p>
<p>And still in his empty mind crowded, a thousand-fold,</p>
<p>The deeds of the strong and the songs of the cunning heroes of old.</p>

<p class="s">And now was he come to a place Taiárapu honoured the most,</p>
<p>Where a silent valley of woods debouched on the noisy coast,</p>
<p>Spewing a level river. There was a haunt of Pai.<a name="FnAnchor_2c" href="#Footnote_2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>
<p>There, in his potent youth, when his parents drove him to die,</p>
<p>Honoura lived like a beast, lacking the lamp and the fire,</p>
<p>Washed by the rains of the trade and clotting his hair in the mire;</p>
<p>And there, so mighty his hands, he bent the tree to his foot&mdash;</p>
<p>So keen the spur of his hunger, he plucked it naked of fruit.</p>
<p>There, as she pondered the clouds for the shadow of coming ills,</p>
<p>Ahupu, the woman of song, walked on high on the hills.</p>

<p class="s">Of these was Rahéro sprung, a man of a godly race;</p>
<p>And inherited cunning of spirit, and beauty of body and face.</p>
<p>Of yore in his youth, as an aito, Rahéro wandered the land,</p>
<p>Delighting maids with his tongue, smiting men with his hand.</p>
<p>Famous he was in his youth; but before the midst of his life</p>
<p>Paused, and fashioned a song of farewell to glory and strife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>142</span></p>

<p class="s i1"><i>House of mine</i> (it went), <i>house upon the sea,</i></p>
<p class="i1"><i>Belov&rsquo;d of all my fathers, more belov&rsquo;d by me!</i></p>
<p class="i1"><i>Vale of the strong Honoura, deep ravine of Pai,</i></p>
<p class="i1"><i>Again in your woody summits I hear the trade-wind cry.</i></p>

<p class="s i1"><i>House of mine, in your walls, strong sounds the sea,</i></p>
<p class="i1"><i>Of all sounds on earth, dearest sound to me.</i></p>
<p class="i1"><i>I have heard the applause of men, I have heard it arise and die:</i></p>
<p class="i1"><i>Sweeter now in my house I hear the trade-wind cry.</i></p>

<p class="s">These were the words of his singing, other the thought of his heart;</p>
<p>For secret desire of glory vexed him, dwelling apart.</p>
<p>Lazy and crafty he was, and loved to lie in the sun,</p>
<p>And loved the cackle of talk and the true word uttered in fun;</p>
<p>Lazy he was, his roof was ragged, his table was lean,</p>
<p>And the fish swam safe in his sea, and he gathered the near and the green.</p>
<p>He sat in his house and laughed, but he loathed the king of the land,</p>
<p>And he uttered the grudging word under the covering hand.</p>
<p>Treason spread from his door; and he looked for a day to come,</p>
<p>A day of the crowding people, a day of the summoning drum,</p>
<p>When the vote should be taken, the king be driven forth in disgrace,</p>
<p>And Rahéro, the laughing and lazy, sit and rule in his place.</p>

<p class="s">Here Támatéa came, and beheld the house on the brook;</p>
<p>And Rahéro was there by the way and covered an oven to cook.<a name="FnAnchor_3c" href="#Footnote_3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>143</span></p>
<p>Naked he was to the loins, but the tattoo covered the lack,</p>
<p>And the sun and the shadow of palms dappled his muscular back.</p>
<p>Swiftly he lifted his head at the fall of the coming feet,</p>
<p>And the water sprang in his mouth with a sudden desire of meat:</p>
<p>For he marked the basket carried, covered from flies and the sun;<a name="FnAnchor_4c" href="#Footnote_4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>
<p>And Rahéro buried his fire, but the meat in his house was done.</p>

<p class="s">Forth he stepped; and took, and delayed the boy, by the hand;</p>
<p>And vaunted the joys of meat and the ancient ways of the land:</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;Our sires of old in Taiárapu, they that created the race,</p>
<p>Ate ever with eager hand, nor regarded season or place,</p>
<p>Ate in the boat at the oar, on the way afoot; and at night</p>
<p>Arose in the midst of dreams to rummage the house for a bite.</p>
<p>It is good for the youth in his turn to follow the way of the sire;</p>
<p>And behold how fitting the time! for here do I cover my fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;I see the fire for the cooking, but never the meat to cook,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Támatéa.&mdash;&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; said Rahéro. &ldquo;Here in the brook,</p>
<p>And there in the tumbling sea, the fishes are thick as flies,</p>
<p>Hungry like healthy men, and like pigs for savour and size:</p>
<p>Crayfish crowding the river, sea-fish thronging the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;Well, it may be,&rdquo; says the other, &ldquo;and yet be nothing to me.</p>
<p>Fain would I eat, but alas! I have needful matter in hand,</p>
<p>Since I carry my tribute of fish to the jealous king of the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>144</span></p>

<p class="s">Now at the word a light sprang in Rahéro&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will gain me a dinner,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;and lend the king a surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he took the lad by the arm, as they stood by the side of the track,</p>
<p>And smiled, and rallied, and flattered, and pushed him forward and back.</p>
<p>It was &ldquo;You that sing like a bird, I never have heard you sing,&rdquo;</p>
<p>And &ldquo;The lads when I was a lad were none so feared of a king.</p>
<p>And of what account is an hour, when the heart is empty of guile?</p>
<p>But come, and sit in the house and laugh with the women awhile;</p>
<p>And I will but drop my hook, and behold! the dinner made.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">So Támatéa the pliable hung up his fish in the shade</p>
<p>On a tree by the side of the way; and Rahéro carried him in,</p>
<p>Smiling as smiles the fowler when flutters the bird to the gin,</p>
<p>And chose him a shining hook,<a name="FnAnchor_5c" href="#Footnote_5c"><span class="sp">5</span></a> and viewed it with sedulous eye,</p>
<p>And breathed and burnished it well on the brawn of his naked thigh,</p>
<p>And set a mat for the gull, and bade him be merry and bide,</p>
<p>Like a man concerned for his guest, and the fishing, and nothing beside.</p>

<p class="s">Now when Rahéro was forth, he paused and hearkened, and heard</p>
<p>The gull jest in the house and the women laugh at his word;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>145</span></p>
<p>And stealthily crossed to the side of the way, to the shady place</p>
<p>Where the basket hung on a mango; and craft transfigured his face.</p>
<p>Deftly he opened the basket, and took of the fat of the fish,</p>
<p>The cut of kings and chieftains, enough for a goodly dish.</p>
<p>This he wrapped in a leaf, set on the fire to cook,</p>
<p>And buried; and next the marred remains of the tribute he took,</p>
<p>And doubled and packed them well, and covered the basket close.</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;There is a buffet, my king,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;and a nauseous dose!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>And hung the basket again in the shade, in a cloud of flies;</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;And there is a sauce to your dinner, king of the crafty eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">Soon as the oven was open, the fish smelt excellent good.</p>
<p>In the shade, by the house of Rahéro, down they sat to their food,</p>
<p>And cleared the leaves,<a name="FnAnchor_6c" href="#Footnote_6c"><span class="sp">6</span></a> in silence, or uttered a jest and laughed</p>
<p>And raising the cocoa-nut bowls, buried their faces and quaffed.</p>
<p>But chiefly in silence they ate; and soon as the meal was done,</p>
<p>Rahéro feigned to remember and measured the hour by the sun</p>
<p>And &ldquo;Támatéa,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;it is time to be jogging, my lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">So Támatéa arose, doing ever the thing he was bade,</p>
<p>And carelessly shouldered the basket, and kindly saluted his host;</p>
<p>And again the way of his going was round by the roaring coast.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>146</span></p>
<p>Long he went; and at length was aware of a pleasant green,</p>
<p>And the stems and shadows of palms, and roofs of lodges between.</p>
<p>There sate, in the door of his palace, the king on a kingly seat,</p>
<p>And aitos stood armed around, and the yottowas<a name="FnAnchor_7c" href="#Footnote_7c"><span class="sp">7</span></a> sat at his feet.</p>
<p>But fear was a worm in his heart: fear darted his eyes;</p>
<p>And he probed men&rsquo;s faces for treasons and pondered their speech for lies.</p>
<p>To him came Támatéa, the basket slung in his hand,</p>
<p>And paid him the due obeisance standing as vassals stand.</p>
<p>In silence hearkened the king, and closed the eyes in his face,</p>
<p>Harbouring odious thoughts and the baseless fears of the base;</p>
<p>In silence accepted the gift and sent the giver away.</p>
<p>So Támatéa departed, turning his back on the day.</p>

<p class="s">And lo! as the king sat brooding, a rumour rose in the crowd;</p>
<p>The yottowas nudged and whispered, the commons murmured aloud;</p>
<p>Tittering fell upon all at sight of the impudent thing,</p>
<p>At the sight of a gift unroyal flung in the face of a king.</p>
<p>And the face of the king turned white and red with anger and shame</p>
<p>In their midst; and the heart in his body was water and then was flame;</p>
<p>Till of a sudden, turning, he gripped an aito hard,</p>
<p>A youth that stood with his ómare,<a name="FnAnchor_8c" href="#Footnote_8c"><span class="sp">8</span></a> one of the daily guard,</p>
<p>And spat in his ear a command, and pointed and uttered a name,</p>
<p>And hid in the shade of the house his impotent anger and shame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>147</span></p>

<p class="s">Now Támatéa the fool was far on his homeward way,</p>
<p>The rising night in his face, behind him the dying day.</p>
<p>Rahéro saw him go by, and the heart of Rahéro was glad,</p>
<p>Devising shame to the king and nowise harm to the lad;</p>
<p>And all that dwelt by the way saw and saluted him well,</p>
<p>For he had the face of a friend and the news of the town to tell;</p>
<p>And pleased with the notice of folk, and pleased that his journey was done,</p>
<p>Támatéa drew homeward, turning his back to the sun.</p>

<p class="s">And now was the hour of the bath in Taiárapu: far and near</p>
<p>The lovely laughter of bathers rose and delighted his ear.</p>
<p>Night massed in the valleys; the sun on the mountain coast</p>
<p>Struck, end-long; and above the clouds embattled their host,</p>
<p>And glowed and gloomed on the heights; and the heads of the palms were gems,</p>
<p>And far to the rising eve extended the shade of their stems;</p>
<p>And the shadow of Támatéa hovered already at home.</p>

<p class="s">And sudden the sound of one coming and running light as the foam</p>
<p>Struck on his ear; and he turned, and lo! a man on his track,</p>
<p>Girded and armed with an ómare, following hard at his back.</p>
<p>At a bound the man was upon him;&mdash;and, or ever a word was said,</p>
<p>The loaded end of the ómare fell and laid him dead.</p>

<h3>THE VENGING OF TÁMATÉA</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p><span class="sc">Thus</span> was Rahéro&rsquo;s treason; thus and no further it sped.</p>
<p>The king sat safe in his place and a kindly fool was dead.</p>

<p class="s">But the mother of Támatéa arose with death in her eyes.</p>
<p>All night long, and the next, Taiárapu rang with her cries.</p>
<p>As when a babe in the wood turns with a chill of doubt</p>
<p>And perceives nor home, nor friends, for the trees have closed her about,</p>
<p>The mountain rings and her breast is torn with the voice of despair:</p>
<p>So the lion-like woman idly wearied the air</p>
<p>For a while, and pierced men&rsquo;s hearing in vain, and wounded their hearts.</p>
<p>But as when the weather changes at sea, in dangerous parts,</p>
<p>And sudden the hurricane wrack unrolls up the front of the sky,</p>
<p>At once the ship lies idle, the sails hang silent on high,</p>
<p>The breath of the wind that blew is blown out like the flame of a lamp,</p>
<p>And the silent armies of death draw near with inaudible tramp:</p>
<p>So sudden, the voice of her weeping ceased; in silence she rose</p>
<p>And passed from the house of her sorrow, a woman clothed with repose,</p>
<p>Carrying death in her breast and sharpening death in her hand.</p>

<p class="s">Hither she went and thither in all the coasts of the land.</p>
<p>They tell that she feared not to slumber alone, in the dead of night,</p>
<p>In accursed places; beheld, unblenched, the ribbon of light<a name="FnAnchor_9c" href="#Footnote_9c"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>149</span></p>
<p>Spin from temple to temple; guided the perilous skiff,</p>
<p>Abhorred not the paths of the mountain and trod the verge of the cliff;</p>
<p>From end to end of the island, thought not the distance long,</p>
<p>But forth from king to king carried the tale of her wrong.</p>
<p>To king after king, as they sat in the palace door, she came,</p>
<p>Claiming kinship, declaiming verses, naming her name</p>
<p>And the names of all of her fathers; and still, with a heart on the rack,</p>
<p>Jested to capture a hearing and laughed when they jested back;</p>
<p>So would deceive them a while, and change and return in a breath,</p>
<p>And on all the men of Vaiau imprecate instant death;</p>
<p>And tempt her kings&mdash;for Vaiau was a rich and prosperous land,</p>
<p>And flatter&mdash;for who would attempt it but warriors mighty of hand?</p>
<p>And change in a breath again and rise in a strain of song,</p>
<p>Invoking the beaten drums, beholding the fall of the strong,</p>
<p>Calling the fowls of the air to come and feast on the dead.</p>
<p>And they held the chin in silence, and heard her, and shook the head;</p>
<p>For they knew the men of Taiárapu famous in battle and feast,</p>
<p>Marvellous eaters and smiters: the men of Vaiau not least.</p>
<p>To the land of the Námunu-úra, to Paea,<a name="FnAnchor_10c" href="#Footnote_10c"><span class="sp">10</span></a> at length she came,</p>
<p>To men who were foes to the Tevas and hated their race and name.</p>
<p>There was she well received, and spoke with Hiopa the king.<a name="FnAnchor_11c" href="#Footnote_11c"><span class="sp">11</span></a></p>
<p>And Hiopa listened, and weighed, and wisely considered the thing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>150</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here in the back of the isle we dwell in a sheltered place,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quoth he to the woman, &ldquo;in quiet, a weak and peaceable race.</p>
<p>But far in the teeth of the wind lofty Taiárapu lies;</p>
<p>Strong blows the wind of the trade on its seaward face, and cries</p>
<p>Aloud in the top of arduous mountains, and utters its song</p>
<p>In green continuous forests. Strong is the wind, and strong</p>
<p>And fruitful and hardy the race, famous in battle and feast,</p>
<p>Marvellous eaters and smiters: the men of Vaiau not least.</p>
<p>Now hearken to me, my daughter, and hear a word of the wise:</p>
<p>How a strength goes linked with a weakness, two by two, like the eyes.</p>
<p>They can wield the ómare well and cast the javelin far;</p>
<p>Yet are they greedy and weak as the swine and the children are.</p>
<p>Plant we, then, here at Paea a garden of excellent fruits;</p>
<p>Plant we bananas and kava and taro, the king of roots;</p>
<p>Let the pigs in Paea be tapu<a name="FnAnchor_12c" href="#Footnote_12c"><span class="sp">12</span></a> and no man fish for a year;</p>
<p>And of all the meat in Tahiti gather we threefold here.</p>
<p>So shall the fame of our plenty fill the island and so,</p>
<p>At last, on the tongue of rumour, go where we wish it to go.</p>
<p>Then shall the pigs of Taiárapu raise their snouts in the air;</p>
<p>But we sit quiet and wait, as the fowler sits by the snare,</p>
<p>And tranquilly fold our hands, till the pigs come nosing the food:</p>
<p>But meanwhile build us a house of Trotéa, the stubborn wood,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>151</span></p>
<p>Bind it with incombustible thongs, set a roof to the room,</p>
<p>Too strong for the hands of a man to dissever or fire to consume;</p>
<p>And there, when the pigs come trotting, there shall the feast be spread,</p>
<p>There shall the eye of the morn enlighten the feasters dead.</p>
<p>So be it done; for I have a heart that pities your state,</p>
<p>And Nateva and Námunu-úra are fire and water for hate.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">All was done as he said, and the gardens prospered; and now</p>
<p>The fame of their plenty went out, and word of it came to Vaiau.</p>
<p>For the men of Námunu-úra sailed, to the windward far,</p>
<p>Lay in the offing by south where the towns of the Tevas are,</p>
<p>And cast overboard of their plenty; and lo! at the Tevas&rsquo; feet</p>
<p>The surf on all the beaches tumbled treasures of meat.</p>
<p>In the salt of the sea, a harvest tossed with the refluent foam;</p>
<p>And the children gleaned it in playing, and ate and carried it home;</p>
<p>And the elders stared and debated, and wondered and passed the jest,</p>
<p>But whenever a guest came by eagerly questioned the guest;</p>
<p>And little by little, from one to another, the word went round:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all the borders of Paea the victual rots on the ground,</p>
<p>And swine are plenty as rats. And now, when they fare to the sea,</p>
<p>The men of the Námunu-úra glean from under the tree</p>
<p>And load the canoe to the gunwale with all that is toothsome to eat;</p>
<p>And all day long on the sea the jaws are crushing the meat,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>152</span></p>
<p>The steersman eats at the helm, the rowers munch at the oar,</p>
<p>And at length, when their bellies are full, overboard with the store!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now was the word made true, and soon as the bait was bare,</p>
<p>All the pigs of Taiárapu raised their snouts in the air.</p>
<p>Songs were recited, and kinship was counted, and tales were told</p>
<p>How war had severed of late but peace had cemented of old</p>
<p>The clans of the island. &ldquo;To war,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;now set we an end,</p>
<p>And hie to the Námunu-úra even as a friend to a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">So judged, and a day was named; and soon as the morning broke,</p>
<p>Canoes were thrust in the sea, and the houses emptied of folk.</p>
<p>Strong blew the wind of the south, the wind that gathers the clan;</p>
<p>Along all the line of the reef the clamorous surges ran;</p>
<p>And the clouds were piled on the top of the island mountain-high,</p>
<p>A mountain throned on a mountain. The fleet of canoes swept by</p>
<p>In the midst, on the green lagoon, with a crew released from care,</p>
<p>Sailing an even water, breathing a summer air,</p>
<p>Cheered by a cloudless sun; and ever to left and right,</p>
<p>Bursting surge on the reef, drenching storms on the height.</p>
<p>So the folk of Vaiau sailed and were glad all day,</p>
<p>Coasting the palm-tree cape and crossing the populous bay</p>
<p>By all the towns of the Tevas; and still as they bowled along,</p>
<p>Boat would answer to boat with jest and laughter and song,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>153</span></p>
<p>And the people of all the towns trooped to the sides of the sea,</p>
<p>And gazed from under the hand or sprang aloft on the tree</p>
<p>Hailing and cheering. Time failed them for more to do;</p>
<p>The holiday village careened to the wind, and was gone from view</p>
<p>Swift as a passing bird; and ever as onward it bore,</p>
<p>Like the cry of the passing bird, bequeathed its song to the shore&mdash;</p>
<p>Desirable laughter of maids and the cry of delight of the child.</p>
<p>And the gazer, left behind, stared at the wake and smiled.</p>
<p>By all the towns of the Tevas they went, and Pápara last,</p>
<p>The home of the chief, the place of muster in war; and passed</p>
<p>The march of the lands of the clan, to the lands of an alien folk.</p>
<p>And there, from the dusk of the shoreside palms, a column of smoke</p>
<p>Mounted and wavered and died in the gold of the setting sun,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paea!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;It is Paea.&rdquo; And so was the voyage done.</p>

<p class="s">In the early fall of the night Hiopa came to the shore,</p>
<p>And beheld and counted the comers, and lo, they were forty score;</p>
<p>The pelting feet of the babes that ran already and played,</p>
<p>The clean-lipped smile of the boy, the slender breasts of the maid,</p>
<p>And mighty limbs of women, stalwart mothers of men.</p>
<p>The sires stood forth unabashed; but a little back from his ken</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>154</span></p>
<p>Clustered the scarcely nubile, the lads and maids, in a ring,</p>
<p>Fain of each other, afraid of themselves, aware of the king</p>
<p>And aping behaviour, but clinging together with hands and eyes,</p>
<p>With looks that were kind like kisses, and laughter tender as sighs.</p>
<p>There, too, the grandsire stood, raising his silver crest,</p>
<p>And the impotent hands of a suckling groped in his barren breast.</p>
<p>The childhood of love, the pair well married, the innocent brood,</p>
<p>The tale of the generations repeated and ever renewed&mdash;</p>
<p>Hiopa beheld them together, all the ages of man,</p>
<p>And a moment shook in his purpose.</p>

<p class="s" style="padding-left: 6em;">But these were the foes of his clan,</p>
<p>And he trod upon pity, and came, and civilly greeted the king,</p>
<p>And gravely entreated Rahéro; and for all that could fight or sing,</p>
<p>And claimed a name in the land, had fitting phrases of praise:</p>
<p>But with all who were well-descended he spoke of the ancient days.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that in Paea the victual rots on the ground;</p>
<p>But, friends, your number is many; and pigs must be hunted and found,</p>
<p>And the lads must troop to the mountains to bring the féis down,</p>
<p>And around the bowls of the kava cluster the maids of the town.</p>
<p>So, for to-night, sleep here; but king, common, and priest</p>
<p>To-morrow, in order due, shall sit with me in the feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>155</span></p>
<p>Sleepless the live-long night, Hiopa&rsquo;s followers toiled.</p>
<p>The pigs screamed and were slaughtered; the spars of the guest-house oiled,</p>
<p>The leaves spread on the floor. In many a mountain glen</p>
<p>The moon drew shadows of trees on the naked bodies of men</p>
<p>Plucking and bearing fruits; and in all the bounds of the town</p>
<p>Red glowed the cocoa-nut fires, and were buried and trodden down.</p>
<p>Thus did seven of the yottowas toil with their tale of the clan,</p>
<p>But the eighth wrought with his lads, hid from the sight of man.</p>
<p>In the deeps of the woods they laboured, piling the fuel high</p>
<p>In fagots, the load of a man, fuel seasoned and dry,</p>
<p>Thirsty to seize upon fire and apt to blurt into flame.</p>

<p class="s">And now was the day of the feast. The forests, as morning came,</p>
<p>Tossed in the wind, and the peaks quaked in the blaze of the day&mdash;</p>
<p>And the cocoa-nuts showered on the ground, rebounding and rolling away:</p>
<p>A glorious morn for a feast, a famous wind for a fire.</p>
<p>To the hall of feasting Hiopa led them, mother and sire</p>
<p>And maid and babe in a tale, the whole of the holiday throng.</p>
<p>Smiling they came, garlanded green, not dreaming of wrong;</p>
<p>And for every three, a pig, tenderly cooked in the ground,</p>
<p>Waited; and féi, the staff of life, heaped in a mound</p>
<p>For each where he sat;&mdash;for each, bananas roasted and raw</p>
<p>Piled with a bountiful hand, as for horses hay and straw</p>
<p>Are stacked in a stable; and fish, the food of desire,<a name="FnAnchor_13c" href="#Footnote_13c"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>156</span></p>
<p>And plentiful vessels of sauce, and bread-fruit gilt in the fire;&mdash;</p>
<p>And kava was common as water. Feasts have there been ere now,</p>
<p>And many, but never a feast like that of the folk of Vaiau.</p>
<p>All day long they ate with the resolute greed of brutes,</p>
<p>And turned from the pigs to the fish, and again from the fish to the fruits,</p>
<p>And emptied the vessels of sauce, and drank of the kava deep;</p>
<p>Till the young lay stupid as stones, and the strongest nodded to sleep.</p>
<p>Sleep that was mighty as death and blind as a moonless night</p>
<p>Tethered them hand and foot; and their souls were drowned, and the light</p>
<p>Was cloaked from their eyes. Senseless together, the old and the young,</p>
<p>The fighter deadly to smite and the prater cunning of tongue,</p>
<p>The woman wedded and fruitful, inured to the pangs of birth,</p>
<p>And the maid that knew not of kisses, blindly sprawled on the earth.</p>
<p>From the hall Hiopa the king and his chiefs came stealthily forth.</p>

<p class="s">Already the sun hung low and enlightened the peaks of the north;</p>
<p>But the wind was stubborn to die and blew as it blows at morn,</p>
<p>Showering the nuts in the dusk, and e&rsquo;en as a banner is torn,</p>
<p>High on the peaks of the island, shattered the mountain cloud.</p>
<p>And now at once, at a signal, a silent, emulous crowd</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>157</span></p>
<p>Set hands to the work of death, hurrying to and fro,</p>
<p>Like ants, to furnish the fagots, building them broad and low,</p>
<p>And piling them high and higher around the walls of the hall.</p>
<p>Silence persisted within, for sleep lay heavy on all</p>
<p>But the mother of Támatéa stood at Hiopa&rsquo;s side,</p>
<p>And shook for terror and joy like a girl that is a bride,</p>
<p>Night fell on the toilers, and first Hiopa the wise</p>
<p>Made the round of the hose, visiting all with his eyes;</p>
<p>And all was piled to the eaves, and fuel blockaded the door;</p>
<p>And within, in the house beleaguered, slumbered the forty score.</p>

<p class="s">Then was an aito despatched and came with fire in his hand,</p>
<p>And Hiopa took it.&mdash;&ldquo;Within,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the life of a land;</p>
<p>And behold! I breathe on the coal, I breathe on the dales of the east,</p>
<p>And silence falls on forest and shore; the voice of the feast</p>
<p>Is quenched, and the smoke of cooking; the roof-tree decays and falls</p>
<p>On the empty lodge, and the winds subvert deserted walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">Therewithal, to the fuel, he laid the glowing coal;</p>
<p>And the redness ran in the mass and burrowed within like a mole,</p>
<p>And copious smoke was conceived. But, as when a dam is to burst,</p>
<p>The water lips it and crosses in silver trickles at first,</p>
<p>And then, of a sudden, whelms and bears it away forthright;</p>
<p>So now, in a moment, the flame sprang and towered in the night,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>158</span></p>
<p>And wrestled and roared in the wind, and high over house and tree,</p>
<p>Stood, like a streaming torch, enlightening land and sea.</p>

<p class="s">But the mother of Támatéa threw her arms abroad,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pyre of my son,&rdquo; she shouted, &ldquo;debited vengeance of God,</p>
<p>Late, late, I behold you, yet I behold you at last,</p>
<p>And glory, beholding! For now are the days of my agony past,</p>
<p>The lust that famished my soul now eats and drinks its desire,</p>
<p>And they that encompassed my son shrivel alive in the fire.</p>
<p>Tenfold precious the vengeance that comes after lingering years!</p>
<p>Ye quenched the voice of my singer?&mdash;hark, in your dying ears,</p>
<p>The song of the conflagration! Ye left me a widow alone?</p>
<p>&mdash;Behold, the whole of your race consumes, sinew and bone</p>
<p>And torturing flesh together: man, mother, and maid</p>
<p>Heaped in a common shambles; and already, borne by the trade,</p>
<p>The smoke of your dissolution darkens the stars of night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">Thus she spoke, and her stature grew in the people&rsquo;s sight.</p>

<h3>RAHÉRO</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p><span class="sc">Rahéro</span> was there in the hall asleep: beside him his wife,</p>
<p>Comely, a mirthful woman, one that delighted in life;</p>
<p>And a girl that was ripe for marriage, shy and sly as a mouse;</p>
<p>And a boy, a climber of trees: all the hopes of his house.</p>
<p>Unwary, with open hands, he slept in the midst of his folk,</p>
<p>And dreamed that he heard a voice crying without, and awoke,</p>
<p>Leaping blindly afoot like one from a dream that he fears.</p>
<p>A hellish glow and clouds were about him;&mdash;it roared in his ears</p>
<p>Like the sound of the cataract fall that plunges sudden and steep;</p>
<p>And Rahéro swayed as he stood, and his reason was still asleep.</p>
<p>Now the flame struck hard on the house, wind-wielded, a fracturing blow,</p>
<p>And the end of the roof was burst and fell on the sleepers below;</p>
<p>And the lofty hall, and the feast, and the prostrate bodies of folk,</p>
<p>Shone red in his eyes a moment, and then were swallowed of smoke.</p>
<p>In the mind of Rahéro clearness came; and he opened his throat;</p>
<p>And as when a squall comes sudden, the straining sail of a boat</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>160</span></p>
<p>Thunders aloud and bursts, so thundered the voice of the man.</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;The wind and the rain!&rdquo; he shouted, the mustering word of the clan,<a name="FnAnchor_14c" href="#Footnote_14c"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>
<p>And &ldquo;Up!&rdquo; and &ldquo;To arms, men of Vaiau!&rdquo; But silence replied,</p>
<p>Or only the voice of the gusts of the fire, and nothing beside.</p>

<p class="s">Rahéro stooped and groped. He handled his womankind,</p>
<p>But the fumes of the fire and the kava had quenched the life of their mind,</p>
<p>And they lay like pillars prone; and his hand encountered the boy,</p>
<p>And there sprang in the gloom of his soul a sudden lightning of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him can I save!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;if I were speedy enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he loosened the cloth from his loins, and swaddled the child in the stuff:</p>
<p>And about the strength of his neck he knotted the burden well.</p>

<p class="s">There where the roof had fallen, it roared like the mouth of hell.</p>
<p>Thither Rahéro went, stumbling on senseless folk,</p>
<p>And grappled a post of the house, and began to climb in the smoke:</p>
<p>The last alive of Vaiau; and the son borne by the sire.</p>
<p>The post glowed in the grain with ulcers of eating fire,</p>
<p>And the fire bit to the blood and mangled his hands and thighs;</p>
<p>And the fumes sang in his head like wine and stung in his eyes;</p>
<p>And still he climbed, and came to the top, the place of proof,</p>
<p>And thrust a hand through the flame, and clambered alive on the roof.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>161</span></p>
<p>But even as he did so, the wind, in a garment of flames and pain,</p>
<p>Wrapped him from head to heel; and the waistcloth parted in twain;</p>
<p>And the living fruit of his loins dropped in the fire below.</p>

<p class="s">About the blazing feast-house clustered the eyes of the foe,</p>
<p>Watching, hand upon weapon, lest ever a soul should flee,</p>
<p>Shading the brow from the glare, straining the neck to see.</p>
<p>Only, to leeward, the flames in the wind swept far and wide,</p>
<p>And the forest sputtered on fire; and there might no man abide.</p>
<p>Thither Rahéro crept, and dropped from the burning eaves,</p>
<p>And crouching low to the ground, in a treble covert of leaves</p>
<p>And fire and volleying smoke, ran for the life of his soul</p>
<p>Unseen; and behind him under a furnace of ardent coal,</p>
<p>Cairned with a wonder of flame, and blotting the night with smoke,</p>
<p>Blazed and were smelted together the bones of all his folk.</p>

<p class="s">He fled unguided at first; but hearing the breakers roar,</p>
<p>Thitherward shaped his way, and came at length to the shore.</p>
<p>Sound-limbed he was: dry-eyed; but smarted in every part;</p>
<p>And the mighty cage of his ribs heaved on his straining heart</p>
<p>With sorrow and rage. And &ldquo;Fools!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;fools of Vaiau,</p>
<p>Heads of swine&mdash;gluttons&mdash;Alas! and where are they now?</p>
<p>Those that I played with, those that nursed me, those that I nursed?</p>
<p>God, and I outliving them! I, the least and the worst&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>162</span></p>
<p>I, that thought myself crafty, snared by this herd of swine,</p>
<p>In the tortures of hell and desolate, stripped of all that was mine:</p>
<p>All!&mdash;my friends and my fathers&mdash;the silver heads of yore</p>
<p>That trooped to the council, the children that ran to the open door</p>
<p>Crying with innocent voices and clasping a father&rsquo;s knees!</p>
<p>And mine, my wife&mdash;my daughter&mdash;my sturdy climber of trees,</p>
<p>Ah, never to climb again!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s" style="padding-left: 10em;">Thus in the dusk of the night</p>
<p>(For clouds rolled in the sky and the moon was swallowed from sight),</p>
<p>Pacing and gnawing his fists, Rahéro raged by the shore.</p>
<p>Vengeance: that must be his. But much was to do before;</p>
<p>And first a single life to be snatched from a deadly place,</p>
<p>A life, the root of revenge, surviving plant of the race:</p>
<p>And next the race to be raised anew, and the lands of the clan</p>
<p>Repeopled. So Rahéro designed, a prudent man</p>
<p>Even in wrath, and turned for the means of revenge and escape:</p>
<p>A boat to be seized by stealth, a wife to be taken by rape.</p>

<p class="s">Still was the dark lagoon; beyond on the coral wall,</p>
<p>He saw the breakers shine, he heard them bellow and fall.</p>
<p>Alone, on the top of the reef, a man with a flaming brand</p>
<p>Walked, gazing and pausing, a fish-spear poised in his hand.</p>
<p>The foam boiled to his calf when the mightier breakers came,</p>
<p>And the torch shed in the wind scattering tufts of flame</p>
<p>Afar on the dark lagoon a canoe lay idly at wait:</p>
<p>A figure dimly guiding it: surely the fisherman&rsquo;s mate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>163</span></p>
<p>Rahéro saw and he smiled. He straightened his mighty thews:</p>
<p>Naked, with never a weapon, and covered with scorch and bruise,</p>
<p>He straightened his arms, he filled the void of his body with breath,</p>
<p>And, strong as the wind in his manhood, doomed the fisher to death.</p>

<p class="s">Silent he entered the water, and silently swam, and came</p>
<p>There where the fisher walked, holding on high the flame.</p>
<p>Loud on the pier of the reef volleyed the breach of the sea;</p>
<p>And hard at the back of the man, Rahéro crept to his knee</p>
<p>On the coral, and suddenly sprang and seized him, the elder hand</p>
<p>Clutching the joint of his throat, the other snatching the brand</p>
<p>Ere it had time to fall, and holding it steady and high.</p>
<p>Strong was the fisher, brave, and swift of mind and of eye&mdash;</p>
<p>Strongly he threw in the clutch; but Rahéro resisted the strain,</p>
<p>And jerked, and the spine of life snapped with a crack in twain,</p>
<p>And the man came slack in his hands and tumbled a lump at his feet.</p>

<p class="s">One moment: and there, on the reef, where the breakers whitened and beat,</p>
<p>Rahéro was standing alone, glowing, and scorched and bare,</p>
<p>A victor unknown of any, raising the torch in the air.</p>
<p>But once he drank of his breath, and instantly set him to fish</p>
<p>Like a man intent upon supper at home and a savoury dish.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>164</span></p>
<p>For what should the woman have seen? A man with a torch&mdash;and then</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s blur of the eyes&mdash;and a man with a torch again.</p>
<p>And the torch had scarcely been shaken. &ldquo;Ah, surely,&rdquo; Rahéro said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will deem it a trick of the eyes, a fancy born in the head;</p>
<p>But time must be given the fool to nourish a fool&rsquo;s belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So for a while, a sedulous fisher, he walked the reef,</p>
<p>Pausing at times and gazing, striking at times with the spear:</p>
<p>&mdash;Lastly, uttered the call; and even as the boat drew near,</p>
<p>Like a man that was done with its use, tossed the torch in the sea.</p>

<p class="s">Lightly he leaped on the boat beside the woman; and she</p>
<p>Lightly addressed him, and yielded the paddle and place to sit;</p>
<p>For now the torch was extinguished the night was black as the pit.</p>
<p>Rahéro set him to row, never a word he spoke,</p>
<p>And the boat sang in the water urged by his vigorous stroke.</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; the woman asked, &ldquo;and why did you drop the brand?</p>
<p>We have only to kindle another as soon as we come to land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never a word Rahéro replied, but urged the canoe.</p>
<p>And a chill fell on the woman.&mdash;&ldquo;Atta! speak! is it you?</p>
<p>Speak! Why are you silent? Why do you bend aside?</p>
<p>Wherefore steer to the seaward?&rdquo; thus she panted and cried.</p>
<p>Never a word from the oarsman, toiling there in the dark;</p>
<p>But right for a gate of the reef he silently headed the bark,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>165</span></p>
<p>And wielding the single paddle with passionate sweep on sweep,</p>
<p>Drove her, the little fitted, forth on the open deep.</p>
<p>And fear, there where she sat, froze the woman to stone:</p>
<p>Not fear of the crazy boat and the weltering deep alone;</p>
<p>But a keener fear of the night, the dark, and the ghostly hour,</p>
<p>And the thing that drove the canoe with more than a mortal&rsquo;s power</p>
<p>And more than a mortal&rsquo;s boldness. For much she knew of the dead</p>
<p>That haunt and fish upon reefs, toiling, like men, for bread,</p>
<p>And traffic with human fishers, or slay them and take their ware,</p>
<p>Till the hour when the star of the dead<a name="FnAnchor_15c" href="#Footnote_15c"><span class="sp">15</span></a> goes down, and the morning air</p>
<p>Blows, and the cocks are singing on shore. And surely she knew</p>
<p>The speechless thing at her side belonged to the grave.<a name="FnAnchor_16c" href="#Footnote_16c"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

<p class="s" style="padding-left: 18em;">It blew</p>
<p>All night from the south; all night, Rahéro contended and kept</p>
<p>The prow to the cresting sea; and, silent as though she slept,</p>
<p>The woman huddled and quaked. And now was the peep of day.</p>
<p>High and long on their left the mountainous island lay;</p>
<p>And over the peaks of Taiárapu arrows of sunlight struck.</p>
<p>On shore the birds were beginning to sing: the ghostly ruck</p>
<p>Of the buried had long ago returned to the covered grave;</p>
<p>And here on the sea, the woman, waxing suddenly brave,</p>
<p>Turned her swiftly about and looked in the face of the man.</p>
<p>And sure he was none that she knew, none of her country or clan:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>166</span></p>
<p>A stranger, mother-naked, and marred with the marks of fire,</p>
<p>But comely and great of stature, a man to obey and admire.</p>

<p class="s">And Rahéro regarded her also, fixed, with a frowning face,</p>
<p>Judging the woman&rsquo;s fitness to mother a warlike race.</p>
<p>Broad of shoulder, ample of girdle, long in the thigh,</p>
<p>Deep of bosom she was, and bravely supported his eye.</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;last night the men of your folk&mdash;</p>
<p>Man, woman, and maid, smothered my race in smoke.</p>
<p>It was done like cowards; and I, a mighty man of my hands,</p>
<p>Escaped, a single life; and now to the empty lands</p>
<p>And smokeless hearths of my people, sail, with yourself, alone.</p>
<p>Before your mother was born, the die of to-day was thrown</p>
<p>And you selected:&mdash;your husband, vainly striving, to fall</p>
<p>Broken between these hands:&mdash;yourself to be severed from all,</p>
<p>The places, the people, you love&mdash;home, kindred, and clan&mdash;</p>
<p>And to dwell in a desert and bear the babes of a kinless man.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE PRIEST&rsquo;S VIGIL</h3>


<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p><span class="sc">In</span> all the land of the tribe was neither fish nor fruit,</p>
<p>And the deepest pit of popoi stood empty to the foot.<a name="FnAnchor_1d" href="#Footnote_1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>
<p>The clans upon the left and the clans upon the right</p>
<p>Now oiled their carven maces and scoured their daggers bright;</p>
<p>They gat them to the thicket, to the deepest of the shade,</p>
<p>And lay with sleepless eyes in the deadly ambuscade.</p>
<p>And oft in the starry even the song of morning rose,</p>
<p>What time the oven smoked in the country of their foes;</p>
<p>For oft to loving hearts, and waiting ears and sight,</p>
<p>The lads that went to forage returned not with the night.</p>
<p>Now first the children sickened, and then the women paled,</p>
<p>And the great arms of the warrior no more for war availed.</p>
<p>Hushed was the deep drum, discarded was the dance;</p>
<p>And those that met the priest now glanced at him askance.</p>
<p>The priest was a man of years, his eyes were ruby-red,<a name="FnAnchor_2d" href="#Footnote_2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>
<p>He neither feared the dark nor the terrors of the dead,</p>
<p>He knew the songs of races, the names of ancient date;</p>
<p>And the beard upon his bosom would have bought the chief&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<p>He dwelt in a high-built lodge, hard by the roaring shore,</p>
<p>Raised on a noble terrace and with tikis<a name="FnAnchor_3d" href="#Footnote_3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a> at the door.</p>
<p>Within it was full of riches, for he served his nation well,</p>
<p>And full of the sound of breakers, like the hollow of a shell.</p>
<p>For weeks he let them perish, gave never a helping sign,</p>
<p>But sat on his oiled platform to commune with the divine,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>170</span></p>
<p>But sat on his high terrace, with the tikis by his side,</p>
<p>And stared on the blue ocean, like a parrot, ruby-eyed.</p>

<p class="s">Dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height:</p>
<p>Out on the round of the sea the gems of the morning light,</p>
<p>Up from the round of the sea the streamers of the sun;&mdash;</p>
<p>But down in the depths of the valley the day was not begun.</p>
<p>In the blue of the woody twilight burned red the cocoa-husk,</p>
<p>And the women and men of the clan went forth to bathe in the dusk,</p>
<p>A word that began to go round, a word, a whisper, a start:</p>
<p>Hope that leaped in the bosom, fear that knocked on the heart:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, the priest is not risen&mdash;look, for his door is fast!</p>
<p>He is going to name the victims; he is going to help us at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">Thrice rose the sun to noon; and ever, like one of the dead,</p>
<p>The priest lay still in his house, with the roar of the sea in his head;</p>
<p>There was never a foot on the floor, there was never a whisper of speech;</p>
<p>Only the leering tikis stared on the blinding beach.</p>
<p>Again were the mountains fired, again the morning broke;</p>
<p>And all the houses lay still, but the house of the priest awoke.</p>
<p>Close in their covering roofs lay and trembled the clan,</p>
<p>But the aged, red-eyed priest ran forth like a lunatic man;</p>
<p>And the village panted to see him in the jewels of death again,</p>
<p>In the silver beards of the old and the hair of women slain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>171</span></p>
<p>Frenzy shook in his limbs, frenzy shone in his eyes,</p>
<p>And still and again as he ran, the valley rang with his cries.</p>
<p>All day long in the land, by cliff and thicket and den,</p>
<p>He ran his lunatic rounds, and howled for the flesh of men;</p>
<p>All day long he ate not, nor ever drank of the brook;</p>
<p>And all day long in their houses the people listened and shook&mdash;</p>
<p>All day long in their houses they listened with bated breath,</p>
<p>And never a soul went forth, for the sight of the priest was death.</p>

<p class="s">Three were the days of his running, as the gods appointed of yore,</p>
<p>Two the nights of his sleeping alone in the place of gore:</p>
<p>The drunken slumber of frenzy twice he drank to the lees,</p>
<p>On the sacred stones of the High-place under the sacred trees;</p>
<p>With a lamp at his ashen head he lay in the place of the feast,</p>
<p>And the sacred leaves of the banyan rustled around the priest.</p>
<p>Last, when the stated even fell upon terrace and tree,</p>
<p>And the shade of the lofty island lay leagues away to sea,</p>
<p>And all the valleys of verdure were heavy with manna and musk,</p>
<p>The wreck of the red-eyed priest came gasping home in the dusk.</p>
<p>He reeled across the village, he staggered along the shore,</p>
<p>And between the leering tikis crept groping through his door.</p>

<p class="s">There went a stir through the lodges, the voice of speech awoke;</p>
<p>Once more from the builded platforms arose the evening smoke.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>172</span></p>
<p>And those who were mighty in war, and those renowned for an art</p>
<p>Sat in their stated seats and talked of the morrow apart.</p>

<h3>THE LOVERS</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p><span class="sc">Hark</span>! away in the woods&mdash;for the ears of love are sharp&mdash;</p>
<p>Stealthily, quietly touched, the note of the one-stringed harp.<a name="FnAnchor_4d" href="#Footnote_4d"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>
<p>In the lighted house of her father, why should Taheia start?</p>
<p>Taheia heavy of hair, Taheia tender of heart,</p>
<p>Taheia the well-descended, a bountiful dealer in love,</p>
<p>Nimble of foot like the deer, and kind of eye like the dove?</p>
<p>Sly and shy as a cat, with never a change of face,</p>
<p>Taheia slips to the door, like one that would breathe a space;</p>
<p>Saunters and pauses, and looks at the stars, and lists to the seas;</p>
<p>Then sudden and swift as a cat, she plunges under the trees.</p>
<p>Swift as a cat she runs, with her garment gathered high,</p>
<p>Leaping, nimble of foot, running, certain of eye;</p>
<p>And ever to guide her way over the smooth and the sharp,</p>
<p>Ever nearer and nearer the note of the one-stringed harp;</p>
<p>Till at length, in a glade of the wood, with a naked mountain above,</p>
<p>The sound of the harp thrown down, and she in the arms of her love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rua,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Taheia,&rdquo; they cry&mdash;&ldquo;my heart, my soul, and my eyes,&rdquo;</p>
<p>And clasp and sunder and kiss, with lovely laughter and sighs,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>173</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Rua!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Taheia, my love,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Rua, star of my night,</p>
<p>Clasp me, hold me, and love me, single spring of delight.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">And Rua folded her close, he folded her near and long,</p>
<p>The living knit to the living, and sang the lover&rsquo;s song:</p>

<p class="s i3"><i>Night, night it is, night upon the palms.</i></p>
<p class="i3"><i>Night, night it is, the land-wind has blown.</i></p>
<p class="i3"><i>Starry, starry night, over deep and height;</i></p>
<p class="i3"><i>Love, love in the valley, love all alone.</i></p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Taheia, heavy of hair, a foolish thing have we done,</p>
<p>To bind what gods have sundered unkindly into one.</p>
<p>Why should a lowly lover have touched Taheia&rsquo;s skirt,</p>
<p>Taheia the well-descended, and Rua child of the dirt?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">&mdash;&ldquo;On high with the haka-ikis my father sits in state,</p>
<p>Ten times fifty kinsmen salute him in the gate;</p>
<p>Round all his martial body, and in bands across his face,</p>
<p>The marks of the tattooer proclaim his lofty place.</p>
<p>I too, in the hands of the cunning, in the sacred cabin of palm,<a name="FnAnchor_5d" href="#Footnote_5d"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>
<p>Have shrunk like the mimosa, and bleated like the lamb;</p>
<p>Round half my tender body, that none shall clasp but you,</p>
<p>For a crest and a fair adornment go dainty lines of blue.</p>
<p>Love, love, beloved Rua, love levels all degrees,</p>
<p>And the well-tattooed Taheia clings panting to your knees.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">&mdash;&ldquo;Taheia, song of the morning, how long is the longest love?</p>
<p>A cry, a clasp of the hands, a star that falls from above!</p>
<p>Ever at morn in the blue, and at night when all is black,</p>
<p>Ever it skulks and trembles with the hunter, Death, on its track.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>174</span></p>
<p>Hear me, Taheia, death! For to-morrow the priest shall awake,</p>
<p>And the names be named of the victims to bleed for the nation&rsquo;s sake;</p>
<p>And first of the numbered many that shall be slain ere noon,</p>
<p>Rua the child of the dirt, Rua the kinless loon.</p>
<p>For him shall the drum be beat, for him be raised the song,</p>
<p>For him to the sacred High-place the chanting people throng,</p>
<p>For him the oven smoke as for a speechless beast,</p>
<p>And the sire of my Taheia come greedy to the feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rua, be silent, spare me. Taheia closes her ears.</p>
<p>Pity my yearning heart, pity my girlish years!</p>
<p>Flee from the cruel hands, flee from the knife and coal,</p>
<p>Lie hid in the deeps of the woods, Rua, sire of my soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Whither to flee, Taheia, whither in all of the land?</p>
<p>The fires of the bloody kitchen are kindled on every hand;</p>
<p>On every hand in the isle a hungry whetting of teeth,</p>
<p>Eyes in the trees above, arms in the brush beneath.</p>
<p>Patience to lie in wait, cunning to follow the sleuth,</p>
<p>Abroad the foes I have fought, and at home the friends of my youth.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Love, love, beloved Rua, love has a clearer eye,</p>
<p>Hence from the arms of love you go not forth to die.</p>
<p>There, where the broken mountain drops sheer into the glen,</p>
<p>There shall you find a hold from the boldest hunter of men;</p>
<p>There, in the deep recess, where the sun falls only at noon,</p>
<p>And only once in the night enters the light of the moon,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>175</span></p>
<p>Nor ever a sound but of birds, or the rain when it falls with a shout;</p>
<p>For death and the fear of death beleaguer the valley about.</p>
<p>Tapu it is, but the gods will surely pardon despair;</p>
<p>Tapu, but what of that? If Rua can only dare.</p>
<p>Tapu and tapu and tapu, I know they are every one right;</p>
<p>But the god of every tapu is not always quick to smite.</p>
<p>Lie secret there, my Rua, in the arms of awful gods,</p>
<p>Sleep in the shade of the trees on the couch of the kindly sods,</p>
<p>Sleep and dream of Taheia, Taheia will wake for you;</p>
<p>And whenever the land-wind blows and the woods are heavy with dew,</p>
<p>Alone through the horror of night,<a name="FnAnchor_6d" href="#Footnote_6d"><span class="sp">6</span></a> with food for the soul of her love,</p>
<p>Taheia the undissuaded will hurry true as the dove.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Taheia, the pit of the night crawls with treacherous things,</p>
<p>Spirits of ultimate air and the evil souls of things;</p>
<p>The souls of the dead, the stranglers, that perch in the trees of the wood,</p>
<p>Waiters for all things human, haters of evil and good.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Rua, behold me, kiss me, look in my eyes and read;</p>
<p>Are these the eyes of a maid that would leave her lover in need?</p>
<p>Brave in the eye of day, my father ruled in the fight;</p>
<p>The child of his loins, Taheia, will play the man in the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">So it was spoken, and so agreed, and Taheia arose</p>
<p>And smiled in the stars and was gone, swift as the swallow goes;</p>
<p>And Rua stood on the hill, and sighed, and followed her flight,</p>
<p>And there were the lodges below, each with its door alight;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>176</span></p>
<p>From folk that sat on the terrace and drew out the even long</p>
<p>Sudden crowings of laughter, monotonous drone of song;</p>
<p>The quiet passage of souls over his head in the trees;<a name="FnAnchor_7d" href="#Footnote_7d"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>
<p>And from all around the haven the crumbling thunder of seas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, my home,&rdquo; said Rua. &ldquo;Farewell, O quiet seat!</p>
<p>To-morrow in all your valleys the drum of death shall beat.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE FEAST</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p><span class="sc">Dawn</span> as yellow as sulphur leaped on the naked peak,</p>
<p>And all the village was stirring, for now was the priest to speak.</p>
<p>Forth on his terrace he came, and sat with the chief in talk;</p>
<p>His lips were blackened with fever, his cheeks were whiter than chalk;</p>
<p>Fever clutched at his hands, fever nodded his head,</p>
<p>But, quiet and steady and cruel, his eyes shone ruby-red.</p>
<p>In the earliest rays of the sun the chief rose up content;</p>
<p>Braves were summoned, and drummers; messengers came and went;</p>
<p>Braves ran to their lodges; weapons were snatched from the wall;</p>
<p>The commons herded together, and fear was over them all.</p>
<p>Festival dresses they wore, but the tongue was dry in their mouth,</p>
<p>And the blinking eyes in their faces skirted from north to south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>177</span></p>

<p class="s">Now to the sacred enclosure gathered the greatest and least,</p>
<p>And from under the shade of the banyan arose the voice of the feast,</p>
<p>The frenzied roll of the drum, and a swift monotonous song.</p>
<p>Higher the sun swam up; the trade-wind level and strong</p>
<p>Awoke in the tops of the palms and rattled the fans aloud,</p>
<p>And over the garlanded heads and shining robes of the crowd</p>
<p>Tossed the spiders of shadow, scattered the jewels of sun.</p>
<p>Forty the tale of the drums, and the forty throbbed like one;</p>
<p>A thousand hearts in the crowd, and the even chorus of song,</p>
<p>Swift as the feet of a runner, trampled a thousand strong.</p>
<p>And the old men leered at the ovens and licked their lips for the food;</p>
<p>And the women stared at the lads, and laughed and looked to the wood.</p>
<p>As when the sweltering baker, at night, when the city is dead,</p>
<p>Alone in the trough of labour treads and fashions the bread;</p>
<p>So in the heat, and the reek, and the touch of woman and man,</p>
<p>The naked spirit of evil kneaded the hearts of the clan.</p>

<p class="s">Now cold was at many a heart, and shaking in many a seat;</p>
<p>For there were the empty baskets, but who was to furnish the meat?</p>
<p>For here was the nation assembled, and there were the ovens anigh,</p>
<p>And out of a thousand singers nine were numbered to die.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>178</span></p>
<p>Till, of a sudden, a shock, a mace in the air, a yell,</p>
<p>And, struck in the edge of the crowd, the first of the victims fell.<a name="FnAnchor_8d" href="#Footnote_8d"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>
<p>Terror and horrible glee divided the shrinking clan,</p>
<p>Terror of what was to follow, glee for a diet of man.</p>
<p>Frenzy hurried the chant, frenzy rattled the drums;</p>
<p>The nobles, high on the terrace, greedily mouthed their thumbs;</p>
<p>And once and again and again, in the ignorant crowd below,</p>
<p>Once and again and again descended the murderous blow.</p>
<p>Now smoked the oven, and now, with the cutting lip of a shell,</p>
<p>A butcher of ninety winters jointed the bodies well.</p>
<p>Unto the carven lodge, silent, in order due,</p>
<p>The grandees of the nation one after one withdrew;</p>
<p>And a line of laden bearers brought to the terrace foot,</p>
<p>On poles across their shoulders, the last reserve of fruit.</p>
<p>The victims bled for the nobles in the old appointed way;</p>
<p>The fruit was spread for the commons, for all should eat to-day.</p>
<p>And now was the kava brewed, and now the cocoa ran,</p>
<p>Now was the hour of the dance for child and woman and man;</p>
<p>And mirth was in every heart and a garland on every head,</p>
<p>And all was well with the living and well with the eight who were dead.</p>
<p>Only the chiefs and the priest talked and consulted a while:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; they said, and &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; and nodded and seemed to smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rua the child of dirt, the creature of common clay,</p>
<p>Rua must die to-morrow, since Rua is gone to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>179</span></p>
<p>Out of the groves of the valley, where clear the blackbirds sang,</p>
<p>Sheer from the trees of the valley the face of the mountain sprang;</p>
<p>Sheer and bare it rose, unscalable barricade,</p>
<p>Beaten and blown against by the generous draught of the trade.</p>
<p>Dawn on its fluted brow painted rainbow light,</p>
<p>Close on its pinnacled crown trembled the stars at night.</p>
<p>Here and there in a cleft clustered contorted trees,</p>
<p>Or the silver beard of a stream hung and swung in the breeze,</p>
<p>High overhead, with a cry, the torrents leaped for the main,</p>
<p>And silently sprinkled below in thin perennial rain.</p>
<p>Dark in the staring noon, dark was Rua&rsquo;s ravine,</p>
<p>Damp and cold was the air, and the face of the cliffs was green.</p>
<p>Here, in the rocky pit, accursed already of old,</p>
<p>On a stone in the midst of a river, Rua sat and was cold.</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Valley of mid-day shadows, valley of silent falls,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rua sang, and his voice went hollow about the walls,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valley of shadow and rock, a doleful prison to me,</p>
<p>What is the life you can give to a child of the sun and the sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Rua arose and came to the open mouth of the glen,</p>
<p>Whence he beheld the woods, and the sea, and houses of men.</p>
<p>Wide blew the riotous trade, and smelt in his nostrils good;</p>
<p>It bowed the boats on the bay, and tore and divided the wood;</p>
<p>It smote and sundered the groves as Moses smote with the rod,</p>
<p>And the streamers of all the trees blew like banners abroad;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>180</span></p>
<p>And ever and on, in a lull, the trade-wind brought him along</p>
<p>A far-off patter of drums and a far-off whisper of song.</p>

<p class="s">Swift as the swallow&rsquo;s wings, the diligent hands on the drum</p>
<p>Fluttered and hurried and throbbed. &ldquo;Ah, woe that I hear you come,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rua cried in his grief, &ldquo;a sorrowful sound to me,</p>
<p>Mounting far and faint from the resonant shore of the sea!</p>
<p>Woe in the song! for the grave breathes in the singers&rsquo; breath,</p>
<p>And I hear in the tramp of the drums the beat of the heart of death.</p>
<p>Home of my youth! no more through all the length of the years,</p>
<p>No more to the place of the echoes of early laughter and tears,</p>
<p>No more shall Rua return; no more as the evening ends,</p>
<p>To crowded eyes of welcome, to the reaching hands of friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">All day long from the High-place the drums and the singing came,</p>
<p>And the even fell, and the sun went down, a wheel of flame;</p>
<p>And night came gleaning the shadows and hushing the sounds of the wood;</p>
<p>And silence slept on all, where Rua sorrowed and stood.</p>
<p>But still from the shore of the bay the sound of the festival rang,</p>
<p>And still the crowd in the High-place danced and shouted and sang.</p>

<p class="s">Now over all the isle terror was breathed abroad</p>
<p>Of shadowy hands from the trees and shadowy snares in the sod;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>181</span></p>
<p>And before the nostrils of night, the shuddering hunter of men</p>
<p>Hurried, with beard on shoulder, back to his lighted den.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taheia, here to my side!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Rua, my Rua, you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And cold from the clutch of terror, cold with the damp of the dew,</p>
<p>Taheia, heavy of hair, leaped through the dark to his arms;</p>
<p>Taheia leaped to his clasp, and was folded in from alarms.</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Rua, beloved, here, see what your love has brought;</p>
<p>Coming&mdash;alas! returning&mdash;swift as the shuttle of thought;</p>
<p>Returning, alas! for to-night, with the beaten drum and the voice,</p>
<p>In the shine of many torches must the sleepless clan rejoice;</p>
<p>And Taheia the well-descended, the daughter of chief and priest,</p>
<p>Taheia must sit in her place in the crowded bench of the feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was spoken; and she, girding her garment high,</p>
<p>Fled and was swallowed of woods, swift as the sight of an eye.</p>

<p class="s">Night over isle and sea rolled her curtain of stars,</p>
<p>Then a trouble awoke in the air, the east was banded with bars;</p>
<p>Dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height;</p>
<p>Dawn, in the deepest glen, fell a wonder of light;</p>
<p>High and clear stood the palms in the eye of the brightening east,</p>
<p>And lo! from the sides of the sea the broken sound of the feast!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>182</span></p>
<p>As, when in days of summer, through open windows, the fly</p>
<p>Swift as a breeze and loud as a trump goes by,</p>
<p>But when frosts in the field have pinched the wintering mouse,</p>
<p>Blindly noses and buzzes and hums in the firelit house:</p>
<p>So the sound of the feast gallantly trampled at night,</p>
<p>So it staggered and drooped, and droned in the morning light.</p>

<h3>THE RAID</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p><span class="sc">It</span> chanced that as Rua sat in the valley of silent falls</p>
<p>He heard a calling of doves from high on the cliffy walls.</p>
<p>Fire had fashioned of yore, and time had broken, the rocks;</p>
<p>There were rooting crannies for trees and nesting-places for flocks;</p>
<p>And he saw on the top of the cliffs, looking up from the pit of the shade,</p>
<p>A flicker of wings and sunshine, and trees that swung in the trade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trees swing in the trade,&rdquo; quoth Rua, doubtful of words,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sun stares from the sky, but what should trouble the birds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up from the shade he gazed, where high the parapet shone,</p>
<p>And he was aware of a ledge and of things that moved thereon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What manner of things are these? Are they spirits abroad by day?</p>
<p>Or the foes of my clan that are come, bringing death by a perilous way?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>183</span></p>

<p class="s">The valley was gouged like a vessel, and round like the vessel&rsquo;s lip,</p>
<p>With a cape of the side of the hill thrust forth like the bows of a ship.</p>
<p>On the top of the face of the cape a volley of sun struck fair,</p>
<p>And the cape overhung like a chin a gulf of sunless air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, heart! What is that?&mdash;that, which flickered and shone,</p>
<p>Into the sun for an instant, and in an instant gone?</p>
<p>Was it a warrior&rsquo;s plume, a warrior&rsquo;s girdle of hair?</p>
<p>Swung in the loop of a rope, is he making a bridge of the air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once and again Rua saw, in the trenchant edge of the sky,</p>
<p>The giddy conjuring done. And then, in the blink of an eye,</p>
<p>A scream caught in with the breath, a whirling packet of limbs,</p>
<p>A lump that dived in the gulf, more swift than a dolphin swims;</p>
<p>And there was a lump at his feet, and eyes were alive in the lump.</p>
<p>Sick was the soul of Rua, ambushed close in a clump;</p>
<p>Sick of soul he drew near, making his courage stout;</p>
<p>And he looked in the face of the thing, and the life of the thing went out.</p>
<p>And he gazed on the tattooed limbs, and, behold, he knew the man:</p>
<p>Hoka, a chief of the Vais, the truculent foe of his clan:</p>
<p>Hoka a moment since that stepped in the loop of the rope,</p>
<p>Filled with the lust of war, and alive with courage and hope.</p>

<p class="s">Again to the giddy cornice Rua lifted his eyes,</p>
<p>And again beheld men passing in the armpit of the skies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>184</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Foes of my race!&rdquo; cried Rua, &ldquo;the mouth of Rua is true:</p>
<p>Never a shark in the deep is nobler of soul than you.</p>
<p>There was never a nobler foray, never a bolder plan;</p>
<p>Never a dizzier path was trod by the children of man;</p>
<p>And Rua, your evil-doer through all the days of his years,</p>
<p>Counts it honour to hate you, honour to fall by your spears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Rua straightened his back. &ldquo;O Vais, a scheme for a scheme!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cried Rua and turned and descended the turbulent stair of the stream,</p>
<p>Leaping from rock to rock as the water-wagtail at home</p>
<p>Flits through resonant valleys and skims by boulder and foam.</p>
<p>And Rua burst from the glen and leaped on the shore of the brook,</p>
<p>And straight for the roofs of the clan his vigorous way he took.</p>
<p>Swift were the heels of his flight, and loud behind as he went</p>
<p>Rattled the leaping stones on the line of his long descent.</p>
<p>And ever he thought as he ran, and caught at his gasping breath,</p>
<p>&ldquo;O the fool of a Rua, Rua that runs to his death!</p>
<p>But the right is the right,&rdquo; thought Rua, and ran like the wind on the foam,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right is the right for ever, and home for ever home.</p>
<p>For what though the oven smoke? And what though I die ere morn?</p>
<p>There was I nourished and tended, and there was Taheia born.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">Noon was high on the High-place, the second noon of the feast;</p>
<p>And heat and shameful slumber weighed on people and priest;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>185</span></p>
<p>And the heart drudged slow in bodies heavy with monstrous meals;</p>
<p>And the senseless limbs were scattered abroad like spokes of wheels;</p>
<p>And crapulous women sat and stared at the stones anigh</p>
<p>With a bestial droop of the lip and a swinish rheum in the eye.</p>
<p>As about the dome of the bees in the time for the drones to fall,</p>
<p>The dead and the maimed are scattered, and lie, and stagger, and crawl;</p>
<p>So on the grades of the terrace, in the ardent eye of the day,</p>
<p>The half-awake and the sleepers clustered and crawled and lay;</p>
<p>And loud as the dome of the bees, in the time of a swarming horde,</p>
<p>A horror of many insects hung in the air and roared.</p>
<p>Rua looked and wondered; he said to himself in his heart:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor are the pleasures of life, and death is the better part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But lo! on the higher benches a cluster of tranquil folk</p>
<p>Sat by themselves, nor raised their serious eyes, nor spoke:</p>
<p>Women with robes unruffled and garlands duly arranged,</p>
<p>Gazing far from the feast with faces of people estranged;</p>
<p>And quiet amongst the quiet, and fairer than all the fair,</p>
<p>Taheia, the well-descended, Taheia, heavy of hair.</p>
<p>And the soul of Rua awoke, courage enlightened his eyes</p>
<p>And he uttered a summoning shout and called on the clan to rise.</p>
<p>Over against him at once, in the spotted shade of the trees,</p>
<p>Owlish and blinking creatures scrambled to hands and knees;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>186</span></p>
<p>On the grades of the sacred terrace, the driveller woke to fear,</p>
<p>And the hand of the ham-drooped warrior brandished a wavering spear.</p>
<p>And Rua folded his arms, and scorn discovered his teeth;</p>
<p>Above the war-crowd gibbered, and Rua stood smiling beneath.</p>
<p>Thick, like leaves in the autumn, faint, like April sleet,</p>
<p>Missiles from tremulous hands quivered around his feet;</p>
<p>And Taheia leaped from her place; and the priest, the ruby-eyed,</p>
<p>Ran to the front of the terrace, and brandished his arms and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, O fools, he brings tidings!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hold, &rsquo;tis the love of my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Till lo! in front of the terrace, Rua pierced with a dart.</p>

<p class="s">Taheia cherished his head, and the aged priest stood by,</p>
<p>And gazed with eyes of ruby at Rua&rsquo;s darkening eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taheia, here is the end, I die a death for a man.</p>
<p>I have given the life of my soul to save an unsavable clan.</p>
<p>See them, the drooping of hams! behold me the blinking crew;</p>
<p>Fifty spears they cast, and one of fifty true!</p>
<p>And you, O priest, the foreteller, foretell for yourself if you can,</p>
<p>Foretell the hour of the day when the Vais shall burst on your clan!</p>
<p>By the head of the tapu cleft, with death and fire in their hand,</p>
<p>Thick and silent like ants, the warriors swarm in the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">And they tell that when next the sun had climbed to the noonday skies,</p>
<p>It shone on the smoke of feasting in the country of the Vais.</p>

<p><span class="sc">On</span> the loch-sides of Appin,</p>
  <p class="i1">When the mist blew from the sea,</p>
<p>A Stewart stood with a Cameron:</p>
  <p class="i1">An angry man was he.</p>
<p>The blood beat in his ears,</p>
  <p class="i1">The blood ran hot to his head,</p>
<p>The mist blew from the sea,</p>
  <p class="i1">And there was the Cameron dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, what have I done to my friend,</p>
  <p class="i1">O, what have I done to mysel&rsquo;,</p>
<p>That he should be cold and dead,</p>
  <p class="i1">And I in the danger of all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"></a>189</span></p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Nothing but danger about me,</p>
  <p class="i1">Danger behind and before,</p>
<p>Death at wait in the heather</p>
  <p class="i1">In Appin and Mamore,</p>
<p>Hate at all of the ferries,</p>
  <p class="i1">And death at each of the fords,</p>
<p>Camerons priming gun-locks</p>
  <p class="i1">And Camerons sharpening swords.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">But this was a man of counsel,</p>
  <p class="i1">This was a man of a score,</p>
<p>There dwelt no pawkier Stewart</p>
  <p class="i1">In Appin or Mamore.</p>
<p>He looked on the blowing mist,</p>
  <p class="i1">He looked on the awful dead,</p>
<p>And there came a smile on his face</p>
  <p class="i1">And there slipped a thought in his head.</p>

<p class="s">Out over cairn and moss,</p>
  <p class="i1">Out over scrog and scaur,</p>
<p>He ran as runs the clansman</p>
  <p class="i1">That bears the cross of war.</p>
<p>His heart beat in his body,</p>
  <p class="i1">His hair clove to his face,</p>
<p>When he came at last in the gloaming</p>
  <p class="i1">To the dead man&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>The east was white with the moon,</p>
  <p class="i1">The west with the sun was red,</p>
<p>And there, in the house-doorway,</p>
  <p class="i1">Stood the brother of the dead.</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;I have slain a man to my danger,</p>
  <p class="i1">I have slain a man to my death.</p>
<p>I put my soul in your hands,&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="i1">The panting Stewart saith.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>190</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I lay it bare in your hands,</p>
  <p class="i1">For I know your hands are leal;</p>
<p>And be you my targe and bulwark</p>
  <p class="i1">From the bullet and the steel.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">Then up and spoke the Cameron,</p>
  <p class="i1">And gave him his hand again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There shall never a man in Scotland</p>
  <p class="i1">Set faith in me in vain;</p>
<p>And whatever man you have slaughtered,</p>
  <p class="i1">Of whatever name or line,</p>

  <p class="i1">I make your quarrel mine.<a name="FnAnchor_1e" href="#Footnote_1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>
<p>I bid you in to my fireside,</p>

<p class="s">It fell in the time of midnight,</p>

  <p class="i1">In all the houses of men,</p>
<p>That as the living Cameron</p>
  <p class="i1">Lay sleepless on his bed,</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;My blood is on the heather,</p>
  <p class="i1">My bones are on the hill;</p>
<p>There is joy in the home of ravens</p>
  <p class="i1">That the young shall eat their fill.</p>
<p>My blood is poured in the dust,</p>

<p>Shall gar me withdraw the plighted hand,</p>
  <p class="i1">Or break the word once said.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">Thrice in the time of midnight,</p>
  <p class="i1">When the fox barked in the den,</p>
<p>And the plaids were over the faces</p>
  <p class="i1">In all the houses of men,</p>
<p>Thrice as the living Cameron</p>
  <p class="i1">Lay sleepless on his bed,</p>
<p>Out of the night and the other world</p>
  <p class="i1">Came in to him the dead,</p>
<p>And cried to him for vengeance</p>
  <p class="i1">On the man that laid him low;</p>
<p>And thrice the living Cameron</p>
  <p class="i1">Told the dead Cameron, no.</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Thrice have you seen me, brother,</p>
  <p class="i1">But now shall see me no more,</p>
<p>Till you meet your angry fathers</p>
  <p class="i1">Upon the farther shore.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>193</span></p>
<p>Thrice have I spoken, and now,</p>
  <p class="i1">Before the cock be heard,</p>
<p>I take my leave for ever</p>
  <p class="i1">With the naming of a word.</p>
<p>It shall sing in your sleeping ears,</p>
  <p class="i1">It shall hum in your waking head,</p>
<p>The name&mdash;Ticonderoga,</p>
  <p class="i1">And the warning of the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">Now when the night was over</p>
  <p class="i1">And the time of people&rsquo;s fears,</p>
<p>The Cameron walked abroad,</p>
  <p class="i1">And the word was in his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many a name I know,</p>
  <p class="i1">But never a name like this;</p>
<p>O, where shall I find a skilly man</p>
  <p class="i1">Shall tell me what it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With many a man he counselled</p>
  <p class="i1">Of high and low degree,</p>
<p>With the herdsman on the mountains</p>
  <p class="i1">And the fishers of the sea.</p>
<p>And he came and went unweary,</p>
  <p class="i1">And read the books of yore,</p>
<p>And the runes that were written of old</p>
  <p class="i1">On stones upon the moor.</p>
<p>And many a name he was told,</p>
  <p class="i1">But never the name of his fears&mdash;</p>
<p>Never, in east or west,</p>
  <p class="i1">The name that rang in his ears:</p>
<p>Names of men and of clans;</p>
  <p class="i1">Names for the grass and the tree,</p>
<p>For the smallest tarn in the mountains,</p>
  <p class="i1">The smallest reef in the sea:</p>
<p>Names for the high and low,</p>
  <p class="i1">The names of the craig and the flat;</p>
<p>But in all the land of Scotland,</p>
  <p class="i1">Never a name like that.</p>

  <p class="i1">Of the dying and the dead.</p>

<p class="s">Summer came in the country,</p>
  <p class="i1">Red was the heather bell;</p>
<p>But the manner of the brewing</p>
  <p class="i1">Was none alive to tell.</p>
<p>In the graves that were like children&rsquo;s</p>
  <p class="i1">On many a mountain head,</p>
<p>The Brewsters of the Heather</p>
  <p class="i1">Lay numbered with the dead.</p>

<p class="s">The king in the red moorland</p>
  <p class="i1">Rode on a summer&rsquo;s day;</p>
<p>And the bees hummed, and the curlews</p>
  <p class="i1">Cried beside the way.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>202</span></p>
<p>The king rode, and was angry,</p>
  <p class="i1">Black was his brow and pale,</p>
<p>To rule in a land of heather</p>
  <p class="i1">And lack the Heather Ale.</p>

<p class="s">It fortuned that his vassals,</p>
  <p class="i1">Riding free on the heath,</p>
<p>Came on a stone that was fallen</p>
  <p class="i1">And vermin hid beneath.</p>
<p>Rudely plucked from their hiding,</p>
  <p class="i1">Never a word they spoke:</p>
<p>A son and his aged father&mdash;</p>
  <p class="i1">Last of the dwarfish folk.</p>

<p class="s">The king sat high on his charger,</p>
  <p class="i1">He looked on the little men;</p>
<p>And the dwarfish and swarthy couple</p>
  <p class="i1">Looked at the king again.</p>
<p>Down by the shore he had them;</p>
  <p class="i1">And there on the giddy brink&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you life, ye vermin,</p>
  <p class="i1">For the secret of the drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">There stood the son and father;</p>
  <p class="i1">And they looked high and low;</p>
<p>The heather was red around them,</p>
  <p class="i1">The sea rumbled below.</p>
<p>And up and spoke the father,</p>
  <p class="i1">Shrill was his voice to hear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a word in private,</p>
  <p class="i1">A word for the royal ear.</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;Life is dear to the aged,</p>
  <p class="i1">And honour a little thing;</p>
<p>I would gladly sell the secret,&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="i1">Quoth the Pict to the king.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>203</span></p>
<p>His voice was small as a sparrow&rsquo;s,</p>
  <p class="i1">And shrill and wonderful clear;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would gladly sell my secret,</p>
  <p class="i1">Only my son I fear.</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;For life is a little matter,</p>
  <p class="i1">And death is nought to the young;</p>
<p>And I dare not sell my honour</p>
  <p class="i1">Under the eye of my son.</p>
<p>Take <i>him</i>, O king, and bind him,</p>
  <p class="i1">And cast him far in the deep:</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s I will tell the secret,</p>
  <p class="i1">That I have sworn to keep.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s">They took the son and bound him,</p>
  <p class="i1">Neck and heels in a thong,</p>
<p>And a lad took him and swung him,</p>
  <p class="i1">And flung him far and strong,</p>
<p>And the sea swallowed his body,</p>
  <p class="i1">Like that of a child of ten;&mdash;</p>
<p>And there on the cliff stood the father,</p>
  <p class="i1">Last of the dwarfish men.</p>

<p class="s">&ldquo;True was the word I told you:</p>
  <p class="i1">Only my son I feared;</p>
<p>For I doubt the sapling courage</p>
  <p class="i1">That goes without the beard.</p>
<p>But now in vain is the torture,</p>
  <p class="i1">Fire shall never avail;</p>
<p>Here dies in my bosom</p>
  <p class="i1">The secret of Heather Ale.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>NOTES TO THE SONG OF RAHÉRO</h3>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Introduction</span>.&mdash;This tale, of which I have not consciously changed
a single feature, I received from tradition. It is highly popular
through all the country of the eight Tevas, the clan to which Rahéro
belonged; and particularly in Taiárapu, the windward peninsula
of Tahiti, where he lived. I have heard from end to end two
versions; and as many as five different persons have helped me
with details. There seems no reason why the tale should not be
true.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1c" href="#FnAnchor_1c">Note 1</a>, page 140. &ldquo;<i>The aito</i>,&rdquo; <i>quasi</i> champion, or brave. One
skilled in the use of some weapon, who wandered the country
challenging distinguished rivals and taking part in local quarrels.
It was in the natural course of his advancement to be at last employed
by a chief, or king; and it would then be a part of his duties
to purvey the victim for sacrifice. One of the doomed families
was indicated; the aito took his weapon and went forth alone;
a little behind him bearers followed with the sacrificial basket.
Sometimes the victim showed fight, sometimes prevailed; more
often, without doubt, he fell. But whatever body was found, the
bearers indifferently took up.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2c" href="#FnAnchor_2c">Note 2</a>, page 141. &ldquo;<i>Pai</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Honoura</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Ahupu</i>.&rdquo; Legendary
persons of Tahiti, all natives of Taiárapu. Of the first two I
have collected singular although imperfect legends, which I hope
soon to lay before the public in another place. Of Ahupu, except
in snatches of song, little memory appears to linger. She dwelt at
least about Tepari,&mdash;&ldquo;the sea-cliffs,&rdquo;&mdash;the eastern fastness of the
isle; walked by paths known only to herself upon the mountains;
was courted by dangerous suitors who came swimming from adjacent
islands, and defended and rescued (as I gather) by the loyalty
of native fish. My anxiety to learn more of &ldquo;Ahupu Vehine&rdquo;
became (during my stay in Taiárapu) a cause of some diversion
to that mirthful people, the inhabitants.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3c" href="#FnAnchor_3c">Note 3</a>, page 142. &ldquo;<i>Covered an oven.</i>&rdquo; The cooking fire is made
in a hole in the ground, and is then buried.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4c" href="#FnAnchor_4c">Note 4</a>, page 143. &ldquo;<i>Flies.</i>&rdquo; This is perhaps an anachronism.
Even speaking of to-day in Tahiti, the phrase would have to be
understood as referring mainly to mosquitoes, and these only in
watered valleys with close woods, such as I suppose to form the
surroundings of Rahéro&rsquo;s homestead. A quarter of a mile away,
where the air moves freely, you shall look in vain for one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>212</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5c" href="#FnAnchor_5c">Note 5</a>, page 144. &ldquo;<i>Hook</i>&rdquo; of mother-of-pearl. Bright-hook fishing,
and that with the spear, appear to be the favourite native methods.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6c" href="#FnAnchor_6c">Note 6</a>, page 145. &ldquo;<i>Leaves</i>,&rdquo; the plates of Tahiti.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7c" href="#FnAnchor_7c">Note 7</a>, page 146. &ldquo;<i>Yottowas</i>,&rdquo; so spelt for convenience of
pronunciation, <i>quasi</i> Tacksmen in the Scottish Highlands. The
organisation of eight sub-districts and eight yottowas to a division,
which was in use (until yesterday) among the Tevas, I have
attributed without authority to the next clan (see page 155).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_8c" href="#FnAnchor_8c">Note 8</a>, page 146. &ldquo;<i>Omare</i>,&rdquo; pronounce as a dactyl. A loaded
quarterstaff, one of the two favourite weapons of the Tahitian
brave; the javelin, or casting spear, was the other.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_9c" href="#FnAnchor_9c">Note 9</a>, page 148. &ldquo;<i>The ribbon of light.</i>&rdquo; Still to be seen (and
heard) spinning from one marae to another on Tahiti; or so I have
it upon evidence that would rejoice the Psychical Society.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_10c" href="#FnAnchor_10c">Note 10</a>, page 149. &ldquo;<i>Námunu-úra.</i>&rdquo; The complete name is
Námunu-úra te aropa. Why it should be pronounced Námunu,
dactylically, I cannot see, but so I have always heard it. This
was the clan immediately beyond the Tevas on the south coast
of the island. At the date of the tale the clan organisation must
have been very weak. There is no particular mention of Támatéa&rsquo;s
mother going to Papara, to the head chief of her own clan, which
would appear her natural recourse. On the other hand, she seems
to have visited various lesser chiefs among the Tevas, and these
to have excused themselves solely on the danger of the enterprise.
The broad distinction here drawn between Nateva and Námunu-úra
is therefore not impossibly anachronistic.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_11c" href="#FnAnchor_11c">Note 11</a>, page 149. &ldquo;<i>Hiopa the king.</i>&rdquo; Hiopa was really the
name of the king (chief) of Vaiau; but I could never learn that
of the king of Paea&mdash;pronounce to rhyme with the Indian <i>ayah</i>&mdash;and
I gave the name where it was most needed. This note must
appear otiose indeed to readers who have never heard of either
of these two gentlemen; and perhaps there is only one person in
the world capable at once of reading my verses and spying the
inaccuracy. For him, for Mr. Tati Salmon, hereditary high chief
of the Tevas, the note is solely written: a small attention from a
clansman to his chief.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_12c" href="#FnAnchor_12c">Note 12</a>, page 150. &ldquo;<i>Let the pigs be tapu.</i>&rdquo; It is impossible to
explain <i>tapu</i> in a note; we have it as an English word, taboo. Suffice
it, that a thing which was <i>tapu</i> must not be touched, nor a place
that was <i>tapu</i> visited.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_13c" href="#FnAnchor_13c">Note 13</a>, page 155. &ldquo;<i>Fish, the food of desire.</i>&rdquo; There is a special
word in the Tahitian language to signify <i>hungering after fish</i>. I may
remark that here is one of my chief difficulties about the whole
story. How did king, commons, women, and all come to eat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>213</span>
together at this feast? But it troubled none of my numerous
authorities; so there must certainly be some natural explanation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_14c" href="#FnAnchor_14c">Note 14</a>, page 160. &ldquo;<i>The mustering word of the clan.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Notes <a name="Footnote_15c" href="#FnAnchor_15c">15</a> and <a name="Footnote_16c" href="#FnAnchor_16c">16</a>, page 165. &ldquo;<i>The star of the dead.</i>&rdquo; Venus as
a morning star. I have collected much curious evidence as to
this belief. The dead retain their taste for a fish diet, enter into
copartnery with living fishers, and haunt the reef and the lagoon.
The conclusion attributed to the nameless lady of the legend would
be reached to-day, under the like circumstances, by ninety per cent.
of Polynesians: and here I probably under-state by one-tenth.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE</h3>

<div class="quote">
<p>In this ballad I have strung together some of the more striking
particularities of the Marquesas. It rests upon no authority;
it is in no sense, like &ldquo;Rahéro,&rdquo; a native story; but a patchwork
of details of manners and the impressions of a traveller. It may
seem strange, when the scene is laid upon these profligate islands,
to make the story hinge on love. But love is not less known in the
Marquesas than elsewhere; nor is there any cause of suicide more
common in the islands.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1d" href="#FnAnchor_1d">Note 1</a>, page 169. &ldquo;<i>Pit of popoi.</i>&rdquo; Where the bread-fruit was
stored for preservation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2d" href="#FnAnchor_2d">Note 2</a>, page 169. &ldquo;<i>Ruby-red.</i>&rdquo; The priest&rsquo;s eyes were probably
red from the abuse of kava. His beard (<i>ib.</i>) is said to be worth an
estate; for the beards of old men are the favourite head-adornment
of the Marquesans, as the hair of women formed their most costly
girdle. The former, among this generally beardless and short-lived
people, fetch to-day considerable sums.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3d" href="#FnAnchor_3d">Note 3</a>, page 169. &ldquo;<i>Tikis.</i>&rdquo; The tiki is an ugly image hewn out
of wood or stone.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4d" href="#FnAnchor_4d">Note 4</a>, page 172. &ldquo;<i>The one-stringed harp.</i>&rdquo; Usually employed
for serenades.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5d" href="#FnAnchor_5d">Note 5</a>, page 173. &ldquo;<i>The sacred cabin of palm.</i>&rdquo; Which, however,
no woman could approach. I do not know where women were
tattooed; probably in the common house, or in the bush, for a
woman was a creature of small account. I must guard the reader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>214</span>
against supposing Taheia was at all disfigured; the art of the
Marquesan tattooer is extreme; and she would appear to be clothed
in a web of lace, inimitably delicate, exquisite in pattern, and of a
bluish hue that at once contrasts and harmonises with the warm
pigment of the native skin. It would be hard to find a woman
more becomingly adorned than &ldquo;a well-tattooed&rdquo; Marquesan.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6d" href="#FnAnchor_6d">Note 6</a>, page 175. &ldquo;<i>The horror of night.</i>&rdquo; The Polynesian fear
of ghosts and of the dark has been already referred to. Their life
is beleaguered by the dead.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7d" href="#FnAnchor_7d">Note 7</a>, page 176. &ldquo;<i>The quiet passage of souls.</i>&rdquo; So, I am told,
the natives explain the sound of a little wind passing overhead unfelt.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_8d" href="#FnAnchor_8d">Note 8</a>, page 178. &ldquo;<i>The first of the victims fell.</i>&rdquo; Without
doubt, this whole scene is untrue to fact. The victims were disposed
of privately and some time before. And indeed I am far from
claiming the credit of any high degree of accuracy for this ballad.
Even in the time of famine, it is probable that Marquesan life went
far more gaily than is here represented. But the melancholy of
to-day lies on the writer&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO TICONDEROGA</h3>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Introduction.</span>&mdash;I first heard this legend of my own country from
that friend of men of letters, Mr. Alfred Nutt, &ldquo;there in roaring
London&rsquo;s central stream,&rdquo; and since the ballad first saw the
light of day in <i>Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, Mr. Nutt and Lord Archibald
Campbell have been in public controversy on the facts. Two clans,
the Camerons and the Campbells, lay claim to this bracing story;
and they do well: the man who preferred his plighted troth to the
commands and menaces of the dead is an ancestor worth disputing.
But the Campbells must rest content: they have the broad lands
and the broad page of history; this appanage must be denied them;
for between the name of <i>Cameron</i> and that of <i>Campbell</i> the muse
will never hesitate.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1e" href="#FnAnchor_1e">Note 1</a>, page 191. Mr. Nutt reminds me it was &ldquo;by my sword
and Ben Cruachan&rdquo; the Cameron swore.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2e" href="#FnAnchor_2e">Note 2</a>, page 194. &ldquo;<i>A periwig&rsquo;d lord of London.</i>&rdquo; The first Pitt.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3e" href="#FnAnchor_3e">Note 3</a>, page 195. &ldquo;<i>Cathay.</i>&rdquo; There must be some omission in
General Stewart&rsquo;s charming &ldquo;History of the Highland Regiments,&rdquo;
a book that might well be republished and continued; or it scarce
appears how our friend could have got to China.</p>

<h3>NOTE TO HEATHER ALE</h3>

<div class="quote">
<p>Among the curiosities of human nature this legend claims a high
place. It is needless to remind the reader that the Picts were never
exterminated, and form to this day a large proportion of the folk
of Scotland, occupying the eastern and the central parts, from the
Firth of Forth, or perhaps the Lammermoors, upon the south,
to the Ord of Caithness on the north. That the blundering guess
of a dull chronicler should have inspired men with imaginary
loathing for their own ancestors is already strange; that it should
have begotten this wild legend seems incredible. Is it possible the
chronicler&rsquo;s error was merely nominal? that what he told, and what
the people proved themselves so ready to receive, about the Picts,
was true or partly true of some anterior and perhaps Lappish
savages, small of stature, black of hue, dwelling underground&mdash;possibly
also the distillers of some forgotten spirit? See Mr.
Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tales of the West Highlands.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poemr">

<p><span class="sc">In</span> all the grove, nor stream nor bird</p>
<p>Nor aught beside my blows was heard,</p>
<p>And the woods wore their noonday dress&mdash;</p>
<p>The glory of their silentness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250"></a>250</span></p>
<p>From the island summit to the seas,</p>
<p>Trees mounted, and trees drooped, and trees</p>
<p>Groped upward in the gaps. The green</p>
<p>Inarboured talus and ravine</p>
<p>By fathoms. By the multitude,</p>
<p>The rugged columns of the wood</p>
<p>And bunches of the branches stood:</p>
<p>Thick as a mob, deep as a sea,</p>
<p>And silent as eternity.</p>

<p class="s">With lowered axe, with backward head,</p>
<p>Late from this scene my labourer fled,</p>
<p>And with a ravelled tale to tell,</p>
<p>Returned. Some denizen of hell,</p>
<p>Dead man or disinvested god,</p>
<p>Had close behind him peered and trod,</p>
<p>And triumphed when he turned to flee.</p>
<p>How different fell the lines with me!</p>
<p>Whose eye explored the dim arcade</p>
<p>Impatient of the uncoming shade&mdash;</p>
<p>Shy elf, or dryad pale and cold,</p>
<p>Or mystic lingerer from of old:</p>
<p>Vainly. The fair and stately things,</p>
<p>Impassive as departed kings,</p>
<p>All still in the wood&rsquo;s stillness stood,</p>
<p>And dumb. The rooted multitude</p>
<p>Nodded and brooded, bloomed and dreamed,</p>
<p>Unmeaning, undivined. It seemed</p>
<p>No other art, no hope, they knew,</p>
<p>Than clutch the earth and seek the blue.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Mid vegetable king and priest</p>
<p>And stripling, I (the only beast)</p>
<p>Was at the beast&rsquo;s work, killing; hewed</p>
<p>The stubborn roots across, bestrewed</p>
<p>The glebe with the dislustred leaves,</p>
<p>And bade the saplings fall in sheaves;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>251</span></p>
<p>Bursting across the tangled math</p>
<p>A ruin that I called a path,</p>
<p>A Golgotha that, later on,</p>
<p>When rains had watered, and suns shone,</p>
<p>And seeds enriched the place, should bear</p>
<p>And be called garden. Here and there,</p>
<p>I spied and plucked by the green hair</p>
<p>A foe more resolute to live,</p>
<p>The toothed and killing sensitive.</p>
<p>He, semi-conscious, fled the attack;</p>
<p>He shrank and tucked his branches back;</p>
<p>And straining by his anchor strand,</p>
<p>Captured and scratched the rooting hand.</p>
<p>I saw him crouch, I felt him bite;</p>
<p>And straight my eyes were touched with sight.</p>
<p>I saw the wood for what it was;</p>
<p>The lost and the victorious cause;</p>
<p>The deadly battle pitched in line,</p>
<p>Saw silent weapons cross and shine:</p>
<p>Silent defeat, silent assault,</p>
<p>A battle and a burial vault.</p>

<p class="s">Thick round me in the teeming mud</p>
<p>Briar and fern strove to the blood.</p>
<p>The hooked liana in his gin</p>
<p>Noosed his reluctant neighbours in:</p>
<p>There the green murderer throve and spread,</p>
<p>Upon his smothering victims fed,</p>
<p>And wantoned on his climbing coil.</p>
<p>Contending roots fought for the soil</p>
<p>Like frightened demons: with despair</p>
<p>Competing branches pushed for air.</p>
<p>Green conquerors from overhead</p>
<p>Bestrode the bodies of their dead;</p>
<p>The Caesars of the silvan field,</p>
<p>Unused to fail, foredoomed to yield:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>252</span></p>
<p>For in the groins of branches, lo!</p>
<p>The cancers of the orchid grow.</p>
<p>Silent as in the listed ring</p>
<p>Two chartered wrestlers strain and cling,</p>
<p>Dumb as by yellow Hooghly&rsquo;s side</p>
<p>The suffocating captives died:</p>
<p>So hushed the woodland warfare goes</p>
<p>Unceasing; and the silent foes</p>
<p>Grapple and smother, strain and clasp</p>
<p>Without a cry, without a gasp.</p>
<p>Here also sound Thy fans, O God,</p>
<p>Here too Thy banners move abroad:</p>
<p>Forest and city, sea and shore,</p>
<p>And the whole earth, Thy threshing-floor!</p>
<p>The drums of war, the drums of peace,</p>
<p>Roll through our cities without cease,</p>
<p>And all the iron halls of life</p>
<p>Ring with the unremitting strife.</p>

<p class="s">The common lot we scarce perceive.</p>
<p>Crowds perish, we nor mark nor grieve:</p>
<p>The bugle calls&mdash;we mourn a few!</p>
<p>What corporal&rsquo;s guard at Waterloo?</p>
<p>What scanty hundreds more or less</p>
<p>In the man-devouring Wilderness?</p>
<p>What handful bled on Delhi ridge?</p>
<p>&mdash;See, rather, London, on thy bridge</p>
<p>The pale battalions trample by,</p>
<p>Resolved to slay, resigned to die.</p>
<p>Count, rather, all the maimed and dead</p>
<p>In the unbrotherly war of bread.</p>
<p>See, rather, under sultrier skies</p>
<p>What vegetable Londons rise,</p>
<p>And teem, and suffer without sound.</p>
<p>Or in your tranquil garden ground,</p>
<p>Contented, in the falling gloom,</p>
<p>Saunter and see the roses bloom.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>253</span></p>
<p>That these might live, what thousands died!</p>
<p>All day the cruel hoe was plied;</p>
<p>The ambulance barrow rolled all day;</p>
<p>Your wife, the tender, kind, and gay,</p>
<p>Donned her long gauntlets, caught the spud</p>
<p>And bathed in vegetable blood;</p>
<p>And the long massacre now at end,</p>
<p>See! where the lazy coils ascend,</p>
<p>See, where the bonfire sputters red</p>
<p>At even, for the innocent dead.</p>

<p class="s">Why prate of peace? when, warriors all,</p>
<p>We clank in harness into hall,</p>
<p>And ever bare upon the board</p>
<p>Lies the necessary sword.</p>
<p>In the green field or quiet street,</p>
<p>Besieged we sleep, beleaguered eat;</p>
<p>Labour by day and wake o&rsquo; nights,</p>
<p>In war with rival appetites.</p>
<p>The rose on roses feeds; the lark</p>
<p>On larks. The sedentary clerk</p>
<p>All morning with a diligent pen</p>
<p>Murders the babes of other men;</p>
<p>And like the beasts of wood and park,</p>
<p>Protects his whelps, defends his den.</p>

<p class="s">Unshamed the narrow aim I hold;</p>
<p>I feed my sheep, patrol my fold;</p>
<p>Breathe war on wolves and rival flocks,</p>
<p>A pious outlaw on the rocks</p>
<p>Of God and morning; and when time</p>
<p>Shall bow, or rivals break me, climb</p>
<p>Where no undubbed civilian dares,</p>
<p>In my war harness, the loud stairs</p>
<p>Of honour; and my conqueror</p>
<p>Hail me a warrior fallen in war.</p>
